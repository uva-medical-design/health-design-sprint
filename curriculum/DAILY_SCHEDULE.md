- **Loom**: Record user testing sessions for review
- **NotebookLM**: Upload test session notes; analyze patterns

### Discussion Prompts
1. "What's the most important thing you learned from user testing today?"
2. "When should you fix a problem vs. document it for future work?"
3. "How do you stay objective when users struggle with something you built?"

### Task-Based Testing Protocol
```
INTRODUCTION (2 min)
"Thanks for helping us test this. We're testing the prototype, not you—
there are no wrong answers. Think aloud as you go."

TASKS (15-20 min)
Task 1: [Primary action, e.g., "Find the symptom checker and check your symptoms"]
- Observe: Did they complete it? How long? Any confusion?
Task 2: [Secondary action]
Task 3: [Edge case or recovery scenario]

DEBRIEF (5 min)
"What was that like for you?"
"What was confusing?"
"What would you change?"
"Would you use this? Why or why not?"
```

### Deliverables (Due by 6:00 PM)
- [ ] 4-6 user testing sessions completed
- [ ] Task success rate documented (e.g., "4/5 completed Task 1")
- [ ] Prioritized issue list (critical / important / nice-to-have)
- [ ] Iteration log: What did you change?
- [ ] Updated prototype deployed
- [ ] Known issues and future work documented

## Day 9: Demo to Reliable System + Handoff Package Prep
**Thursday, February 26, 2026**

### Theme
*"A great prototype that no one else can understand or run has no impact. Document for continuity."*

### Learning Objectives
