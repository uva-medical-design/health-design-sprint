**Format:** Virtual (recorded)
**Duration:** 60 minutes

## Learning Objectives

| Knowledge | Skills | Mindset |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Understand the current AI inflection point and its implications | Articulate problems clearly for AI collaboration | Embrace "I can build this" over "I can't code" |
| Know the three competencies model (domain + design + AI fluency) | Navigate informal knowledge sources (Twitter, YouTube, podcasts) | See AI as collaborator, not replacement |
| Recognize why process persists while tools change | Evaluate AI tool capabilities for specific tasks | Accept that today's tools will seem quaint soon |

## Session Flow

### Opening (5 min)

**Welcome and framing**
- Welcome to the Health Design Sprint
- Two weeks, one functional prototype, infinite learning
- Today: set the context for everything that follows

**Icebreaker question** (show in chat):
> "What's something you wish you could build but assumed required coding skills?"

---

### Part 1: The Inflection Point (15 min)

**Key message:** We're at a qualitative shift in AI capability—measured in weeks, not years.

**Talking points:**
1. Claude Opus 4.5 / GPT-4.5 represent genuine capability jumps
2. "Agentic" AI: systems that execute multi-step tasks autonomously
3. The "vibe coding" phenomenon: non-programmers building real software
4. Live demo: Show a simple app built entirely through conversation

**Demo suggestion:**
- Open Claude Code
- Build a simple symptom checker or patient intake form in real-time
- Emphasize: "I'm not writing code, I'm describing what I want"

**Discussion prompt:**
> "What could you build today that was impossible a year ago?"

---

### Part 2: Democratization, Not Technology (10 min)

**Key message:** The breakthrough isn't smarter AI—it's that capability is now accessible to domain experts.

**Talking points:**
1. Old model: idea → hire developer → months → maybe a prototype
2. New model: idea → articulate clearly → hours → functional prototype
3. The bottleneck shifted from technical skill to problem clarity
4. **You** understand healthcare. Technologists often don't.

**Discussion prompt:**
> "What healthcare problems do you understand deeply that technologists don't?"

---

### Part 3: The Three Competencies (10 min)

**Key message:** The new professional toolkit isn't about coding.

**Visual: Three overlapping circles**
1. **Domain expertise** - Understanding healthcare pain points, workflows, stakeholders
2. **Design thinking** - Methods for understanding users, mapping workflows, iterating
3. **AI fluency** - Articulating needs for increasingly autonomous systems

**Talking points:**
- You already have domain expertise (or are building it in clinical training)
- This course teaches design thinking methods
- AI fluency ≠ coding; it's about clear communication

**Self-assessment prompt:**
> "Which of these three is your strength? Which is your growth area?"

---

### Part 4: Tools Change, Process Persists (10 min)

**Key message:** The specific tools we use will seem quaint in six months. The process compounds.

**Talking points:**
1. 2023: ChatGPT was the tool
2. 2024: Claude and GPT-4 dominated
3. 2025: Agentic systems emerging
4. 2026: ??? (and that's okay)

**The meta-skill:** Rapidly adopting new tools by understanding underlying patterns

**On informal learning:**
- Peer-reviewed literature lags months/years behind practice
- Twitter, YouTube, podcasts, Discord are primary sources now
- The skill: curating reliable sources, filtering signal from noise

**Discussion prompt:**
> "Where do you learn about new developments? How do you know what to trust?"

---

### Part 5: From Chat to Agent (5 min)

**Key message:** The shift from chat to agent requires systems thinking.

**Preview of Day 4 workshop:**
- Chat: human in the loop for every step
- Agent: human defines goal, AI executes multi-step plan
- This requires thinking about: success criteria, data access, feedback loops, failure modes

**Teaser:**
> "On Day 4, we'll learn how to write specifications that agents can execute."

---

### Closing (5 min)

**Mindset shifts to carry forward:**

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| "I can't code" | "I can articulate what I need" |
| "AI is a search engine" | "AI is a collaborator" |
| "Prototypes need to be polished" | "Prototypes are experiments" |
| "Failure is bad" | "Failed experiments are data" |

**Closing statement:**
> "In six months, the specific tools we use will be outdated. But your ability to understand users, articulate problems clearly, and work with AI systems—that compounds. That's what we're building here."

**Transition:**
- Break, then discussion session
- After lunch: Design Sprint Speedrun exercise
