# COURSE METADATA
# ============================================================
course:
  name: "Health Design Sprint: Rapid Prototyping with AI"
  code: "M4-HDS-2026"
  version: "1.0-pilot"
  
  dates:
    start: "2026-02-16"  # Monday
    end: "2026-02-27"    # Friday
    duration_days: 10
    duration_weeks: 2
    
  schedule_context:
    match_list_deadline: "2026-02-28"  # Students may have this on their minds
    note: "Course ends day before match deadline - acknowledge but don't dwell"
    
  campuses:
    - name: "UVA Charlottesville"
      code: "cville"
      location: "Medical Design Lab, 1400 University Ave, Room B020"
      
    - name: "INOVA"
      code: "inova"
      location: "TBD - coordinate with Pamela Crawford"
      
  enrollment:
    min: 6
    max: 16
    current: 7
    
  delivery:
    mode: "virtual-first"
    rationale: >
      Virtual-first ensures neither campus feels secondary.
      Many students will be remote regardless of campus assignment.
      Recordings become course materials.
      Transcript workflows are easier to teach virtually.
