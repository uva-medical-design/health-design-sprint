# Brand Design Brief
## Medical Design Program: `<mdp>`

**Created:** January 2025
**Status:** v1 — Monochrome launch version

---

## Design Challenge

Create a visual identity for an AI-forward medical education program that:
1. Signals technical sophistication without being intimidating
2. Appeals to medical students (not traditional CS/engineering aesthetic)
3. Works across digital and presentation contexts
4. Can evolve as the program grows
5. Avoids confusion with UVA institutional branding

---

## Core Concept: Chevron Brackets

The `< >` characters encode the fundamental rhythm of design thinking:

### Diverge `<`
- Opening up
- Exploring possibilities
- Generating options
- Research, ideation, brainstorming

### Converge `>`
- Focusing down
- Synthesizing
- Making decisions
- Selection, refinement, delivery

### The Full Cycle `<>`
Design thinking is iterative. The open-close pattern represents one complete cycle of diverge-then-converge.

### Sprint Mode `<<>>`
Rapid iteration — multiple cycles compressed. This is the energy of the Health Design Sprint.

---

## Why This Works

### Technical Without Being Code
Chevron brackets appear in code, markup, and technical contexts. They signal "this is a technical space" without requiring viewers to understand programming. Medical students recognize it as "tech-adjacent" without feeling excluded.

### Process, Not Product
The mark represents *how we work*, not what we make. This is intentional — the program teaches methodology that persists even as specific tools change.

### Scalable Concept
The diverge/converge metaphor can extend to:
- Animations (brackets opening/closing)
- Diagrams (phases of the sprint)
- Iconography (using `<` and `>` as directional elements)

---

## The Mark: `<mdp>`

### Construction
```
<mdp>
│ │ │
│ │ └─ program (lowercase, abbreviated)
│ └─── medical design
└───── chevron brackets (the concept)
```

### Typography
- **Font:** JetBrains Mono
- **Case:** Always lowercase
- **Spacing:** Default tracking (no adjustment needed)

### Why JetBrains Mono
1. Free and open source
2. Designed for extended reading
3. Distinguished characters (l vs 1, 0 vs O)
4. Ligature support for `<>` combinations
5. Signals "technical/code" context appropriately

---

## Color Strategy

### v1: Monochrome
For launch, the brand is **monochrome only**. This is intentional:
- Simplifies production
- Works in any context
- Avoids color-meaning confusion
- Allows focus on typography and structure

### Colors to Avoid
| Color | Why |
|-------|-----|
| UVA Navy (#232D4B) | Institutional confusion |
| UVA Orange (#E57200) | Institutional confusion |
| Pure red | Alarm/medical warning associations |
| Standard corporate blue | Generic, undifferentiated |

### Future Expansion
When/if color is added:
- Start with a single accent color
- Use for interactive elements only
- Maintain monochrome as the base

See [Color Specs](specs/color.md) for details.

## Sacred vs. Free Framework

To maintain consistency while allowing creativity, we define **sacred** (unchangeable) and **free** (variable) elements.

### Sacred (Constants)
- Logo form (`<mdp>` in JetBrains Mono)
- Chevron symbol meanings (diverge/converge)
- Typography (JetBrains Mono family)
- Minimum contrast ratios (4.5:1)
- Animation structure (if animated)

### Free (Variables)
- **Color mood:** Which palette is active
- **Density:** How much whitespace
- **Energy:** Static vs. animated
- **Illustration style:** If used
- **Photography treatment:** If used

See [Dynamic Brand](specs/dynamic-brand.md) for mood system.

## Character System

### Spark `<•>`
A simple character that serves as the "voice" of the course/program.

**Usage:**
- Slide transitions ("Let's converge")
- Terminal output (simulated or real)
- Explainer callouts
- 2-3 appearances per presentation maximum

**Personality:**
- Efficient, not chatty
- Curious, not interrogating
- Supportive, not judgmental

### Kaomoji Set (Very Rare)
For moments of empathy and human connection only.

| Character | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` | "It happens" — acknowledging failure |
| `(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻` → `┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)` | Frustration → Recovery (paired) |
| `ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ` | Friendly curiosity |
| `(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞` | Encouragement |

**Frequency:** 2-3 times across entire course. Overuse dilutes impact.

## Domain Portfolio

Owned domains for future use:

| Domain | Intended Use |
|--------|--------------|
| medicaldesignprogram.org | Primary program site |
| medicalai.design | AI-specific initiatives |
| designing.health | Thought leadership / blog |
| [UVA-specific variants] | Institutional landing pages |

---

## Application Examples

### Presentation Slides
- Title slides: Large `<mdp>` centered
- Section dividers: Bracket animation (open → close)
- Footer: Small `<mdp>` mark, page number

### Documents
- Header: `<mdp>` mark left-aligned
- Body: JetBrains Mono for code/technical content
- Headings: JetBrains Mono bold

### Digital
- Favicon: `<>` brackets only
- Social avatar: `<mdp>` in square frame
- Email signature: `<mdp> | Medical Design Program`

## What Success Looks Like

In one year, when someone sees `<mdp>` or the chevron brackets:
1. They recognize it as "that medical design program"
2. They associate it with innovation and AI in healthcare
3. They understand it's about process (design thinking) not just technology
4. They don't confuse it with UVA institutional materials
