# Dynamic Brand System
## Mood Framework for Future Expansion

---

## Overview

The Medical Design Program brand uses a "Sacred/Free" framework:
- **Sacred elements** remain constant (logo, typography, core symbols)
- **Free elements** can vary based on context and mood

This document defines the **mood system** — a set of visual personalities the brand can adopt while maintaining core identity.

---

## Current Status

**v1 (February 2026):** Neutral mood only (monochrome)

The mood system is documented here for future expansion. Current materials should use **Neutral** mood exclusively.

---

## The Six Moods

### 1. Neutral (Default)

**Current active mood for all v1 materials.**

**Use for:** Presentations in dim rooms, code-focused content, evening sessions

**Example contexts:**
- Live coding demonstrations
- Technical deep-dives
- Video content with screen recordings

---

### 3. Warm

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Energy | Welcoming, approachable |
| Color | Warm grays, potential warm accent |
| Typography | May use lighter weights |

| Live coding | Dark |
| Ideation sessions | Energy |
| Formal presentations | Neutral or Cool |
| Community events | Warm |
| External stakeholders | Neutral or Cool |
| Social media | Varies by content |
| Experimental projects | Experimental (with approval) |

## Implementation Guidelines

### Choosing a Mood
1. Consider the audience (students vs. stakeholders)
2. Consider the setting (bright room vs. dim)
3. Consider the energy needed (reflective vs. activating)
4. When in doubt, use Neutral

### Switching Between Moods
- Don't mix moods within a single document/presentation
- Transitions between moods should be intentional (e.g., Day 1 warm → Day 5 energy)
- Series of related materials should maintain consistent mood

### Combining with Sacred Elements
Regardless of mood:
- Logo remains `<mdp>` in JetBrains Mono
- Typography stays JetBrains Mono family
- Chevron meanings (diverge/converge) persist
- Accessibility requirements apply

## Future Additions

As the brand evolves, we may add:

### Seasonal Variations
- Cohort-specific treatments
- Annual theme layers

### Platform-Specific Adaptations
- Social media optimizations
- Video thumbnail treatments
- Interactive web experiences

### Mood Combinations
- Warm + Dark (cozy evening sessions)
- Cool + Energy (high-stakes demos)

## Governance

### Who Can Use Which Moods

| Mood | Approval Needed |
|------|-----------------|
| Neutral | None — default |
| Dark | None — for appropriate contexts |
| Warm | None — for appropriate contexts |
| Cool | None — for appropriate contexts |
| Energy | Program leadership |
| Experimental | Program leadership + design review |

### Review Process
For Energy and Experimental moods:
1. Draft materials in proposed mood
2. Submit to program leadership
3. Review for brand alignment
4. Approve or request adjustments
