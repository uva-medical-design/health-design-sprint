## Still To Do (Not in YAML Yet)

1. **Pre-work materials to create:**
   - claude-setup-guide.md

   - mcp-demystified.md (or video)
   - vapi-student-guide.md

2. **Tool tour videos to record:**
   - Claude Chat Tour (3 min)
   - Claude Code Tour (5 min)
   - Gamma Quick Start (2 min, optional)

3. **Templates to create:**

---

## Open Questions Remaining

1. **Miro:** Still need to research Claude/GitHub integration — worth adding?
2. **Social gathering:** Float at orientation, decide based on response
3. **Third speaker:** Use Day 4 or Day 8 slot if needed — what topic would help?
4. **Speedrun:** Revisit for Day 2 afternoon or skip entirely?
