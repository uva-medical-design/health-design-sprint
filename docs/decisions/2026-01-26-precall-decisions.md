# Decision Log: Pre-Course Student Call
**Date:** 2026-01-26  
**Participants:** Matt Trowbridge + 6 of 7 enrolled students (Farah Turkistani absent)

---

## Key Decisions

### 1. Delivery Format: 100% Virtual
**Decision:** Course will be fully virtual via Zoom, even for Charlottesville-based students.  
**Rationale:** Students unanimously preferred virtual. Maintains equity between Cville and INOVA campuses. Recordings become course materials.  
**Action:** No physical room booking needed. Confirm Zoom recording workflow reliable before Feb 16.

### 2. Project Structure: Individual Projects, Shared Workflow
**Decision:** Students work on individual projects relevant to their specialties, not team-based deliverables.  
**Rationale:** Each student has specific interests tied to their match specialty. Energy was higher for personal relevance than team formation.  
**Structure:** 
- All students progress through same 14-phase workflow together
- Projects are individually scoped to each student's domain
- "Team" collaboration becomes peer review and feedback, not shared outputs
- Short defined sprints around specific workflow steps

**Action required:** Revise evaluation framework — Team Design Brief (25%) and Team Prototype (35%) language needs adjustment to reflect individual projects with peer review component.

### 3. Paradigm Shift Opportunity: Day 1 Speedrun
**Observation:** Students conceptualize AI as "ChatGPT" (chat interface, prompt-response). None mentioned agents or persistent AI systems.  
**Opportunity:** Day 1 speedrun is the moment to demonstrate agent paradigm — AI that runs persistently vs. chat that waits for prompts.  
**Action:** Ensure Day 1 includes live demo of Claude Code or similar agentic workflow to reframe their mental model.

## Student Notes

| Student | Specialty | AI Background | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Danielle | Radiology | — | Interested in contouring, patient experience |
| Derek | Internal Medicine | — | Medical education focus; potential collaboration with M1 survey cohort |
| Christopher | Emergency Medicine | — | Tool-builder mindset, wants to solve problems |
| Matthew Nguyen | Neurosurgery (Baylor) | Computational medicine background | Most technical; remote (match destination, not current location issue) |
| Maddie | Psychiatry | — | Ethical AI focus; balancing clinical benefit with patient autonomy |
| Kevin | Anesthesia | QI/informatics background | Intraoperative monitoring, documentation |
| Farah T. | TBD | TBD | Absent from call — follow up |

**Note:** There are two Farahs — Farah Turkistani (enrolled student, absent) and Farah (department staff, potential GitHub TA support).

## Outstanding Items

- [ ] Get campus assignments (Cville vs INOVA) for all 7 students — needed for admin purposes even with virtual delivery
- [ ] Follow up with Farah Turkistani (missed call)
- [ ] Derek ↔ M1 collaboration: Derek helps M1s think about survey design; M1s provide user testing feedback on Derek's education app
- [ ] Test Zoom scheduled meeting auto-record (tomorrow)
- [ ] Revise evaluation rubric language for individual projects

## Course Philosophy Reinforcement

Students responded well to:
- "Six-month window" framing — AI democratization means domain expertise > coding skill
- Process over polish
- Learning workflows they can take with them

Students will need scaffolding on:
- Thinking in agents, not just chat
- Comfort with ambiguity (mixed signals — some ready, some want more structure)
- Documenting failures as valuable learning
