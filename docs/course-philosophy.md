# Course Philosophy: The Six-Month Window
## Instructor Notes for Day 1 Kickoff Lecture

**Session:** Day 1 Kickoff Lecture
**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Purpose:** Set expectations, frame the moment, establish mindset

---

## Core Thesis

We are at an inflection point in AI capability—measured in weeks, not years. The tools and methods students learn in this course may seem quaint in six months. But the *process* of design thinking combined with AI fluency will persist. This course teaches the durable skills.

## Six Key Points

### 1. Inflection Point Measured in Weeks, Not Years

Claude Opus 4.5 and similar models represent a qualitative shift in AI capability. This is possibly the most significant moment since the original ChatGPT launch—perhaps more significant.

**Talking points:**
- Compare capability gap: GPT-3.5 → GPT-4 → Claude Opus 4.5
- Agentic capabilities: AI can now execute multi-step tasks autonomously
- The "vibe coding" phenomenon: non-programmers building functional software

**Discussion question:** *"What could you build today that was impossible a year ago?"*

---

### 2. The Revolution Is Democratization, Not Technology

The breakthrough isn't that AI got smarter. It's that technical capability is now accessible to anyone with domain expertise and the discipline to articulate problems clearly.

**Talking points:**
- Previously: idea → hire developer → months of work → maybe a prototype
- Now: idea → articulate clearly → functional prototype in hours
- The bottleneck shifted from technical skill to problem clarity

**Discussion question:** *"What healthcare problems do you understand deeply that technologists don't?"*

### 3. Three Competencies for Successful Professionals

The new professional toolkit isn't about coding. It's about:

| Competency | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Domain expertise** | Deep understanding of healthcare pain points, workflows, stakeholders |
| **Design thinking** | Methods for understanding users, mapping workflows, iterating on solutions |
| **AI fluency** | Knowing how to articulate needs for increasingly autonomous systems |

**Talking points:**
- You already have domain expertise (or are building it)
- This course teaches design thinking methods
- AI fluency ≠ coding; it's about clear communication and system design

**Discussion question:** *"Which of these three feels like your strength? Your growth area?"*

---

### 4. Tools Will Seem Quaint in Six Months

The specific platforms we use (Claude, Replit, Vapi) are transient. The process and workflow persist.

**Talking points:**
- In 2023, ChatGPT was the tool; in 2024, Claude and GPT-4; in 2025, agentic systems
- Don't get attached to specific tools—learn the *patterns*
- The meta-skill: rapidly adopting new tools by understanding underlying concepts

**Discussion question:** *"What tools did you use a year ago that you've already abandoned?"*

---

### 5. Textbooks Are Now Podcasts, YouTube, Twitter

Peer-reviewed literature lags months or years behind practice in fast-moving fields. Learning to navigate informal knowledge ecosystems is itself a professional skill.

**Talking points:**
- By the time it's in a journal, the practice has moved on
- Curating reliable sources (who to follow, what to trust)
- The skill of filtering signal from noise
- Reddit, Discord, Twitter as primary sources for AI practice

**Discussion question:** *"Where do you learn about new developments in your field? How do you know what to trust?"*

---

### 6. Agentic AI Requires System Design

The shift from "chat" to "agent" means AI systems need:
- Measurable success criteria
- Data access and APIs
- Feedback loops
- Failure modes and recovery
- Appropriate human oversight

**Talking points:**
- Chat: human in the loop for every step
- Agent: human defines goal, AI executes multi-step plan
- This requires thinking about systems, not just prompts
- PRDs (Product Requirements Documents) become agent specifications

**Discussion question:** *"What's a task you do repeatedly that could be handed to an agent? What would it need to succeed?"*

---

## Mindset Shifts to Establish

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| "I can't code" | "I can articulate what I need" |
| "AI is a search engine" | "AI is a collaborator" |
| "Prototypes need to be polished" | "Prototypes are experiments" |
| "Failure is bad" | "Failed experiments are data" |
| "I need permission to build" | "I can build and test today" |

---

## Connection to Course Structure

This philosophy informs every phase:

- **Weeks 1**: Focus on *understanding* (domain expertise + design thinking)
- **Week 2**: Focus on *building* (AI fluency in action)
- **Throughout**: Treat prototypes as experiments, celebrate what doesn't work

## Closing for Day 1

> "In six months, the specific tools we use will be outdated. But your ability to understand users, articulate problems clearly, and work with AI systems—that compounds. That's what we're building here."
