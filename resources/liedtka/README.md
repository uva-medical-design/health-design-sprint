# Liedtka Design for Growth Resource Collection

A semantically-rich, searchable resource derived from the design thinking methodology in *The Designing for Growth Field Book*.

## Purpose

This collection serves three primary purposes:
1. **AI Agent Support** — Help agents guide students through challenge scoping, research, and ideation
2. **Contextual Retrieval** — Enable semantic search during the Health Design Sprint
3. **Educational Reference** — Provide structured design thinking guidance for MDP courses

## The Four Questions Framework

The Liedtka design thinking process is organized around four fundamental questions:

| Question | Phase | Focus |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **What Is?** | Exploration | Understanding current reality through research and empathy |
| **What If?** | Ideation | Envisioning new possibilities through brainstorming and concept development |
| **What Wows?** | Selection | Identifying concepts that create value at the intersection of desirability, feasibility, and viability |
| **What Works?** | Testing | Validating assumptions through prototypes and learning launches |

## How to Use These Resources

### For Students
- Start with the **framework** docs to understand the overall approach
- Follow the **steps** in sequence for your design sprint
- Reference **tools** as needed for specific activities
- Use the **worked example** to see how a complete project flows

### For AI Agents
- Use the `retrieval_triggers` in each file's frontmatter to match student queries
- Reference `situations` tags to identify when content is relevant
- Follow `related_steps` and `related_tools` for contextual suggestions
- Map to `hds_workflow_phases` to align with Health Design Sprint structure

### For Semantic Search
Each resource includes:
- **retrieval_triggers**: Natural language queries that would lead to this content
- **situations**: Scenarios when this content helps
- **outputs**: What students will produce using this content

## Key Concepts

### Design Thinking Is Appropriate When:
- The problem is human-centered
- Understanding is uncertain or incomplete
- High uncertainty with many unknowns
- Complex interconnected facets
- Limited existing data
- Team has curiosity and influence to explore

### Design Thinking Manages Risk Through:
- Small bets placed fast
- User-centered insights before solutions
- Multiple concepts rather than single bets
- Iterative prototyping and testing
- Learning launches before full rollout
