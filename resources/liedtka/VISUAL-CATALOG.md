# Liedtka Visual Catalog

This catalog lists all visual elements from *The Designing for Growth Field Book* with priority scores for recreation.

## Priority Scoring Criteria

**HIGH Priority** (recreate as branded SVG/HTML):
- Used in first 3 days of sprint
- Students will fill in / interact with
- Core mental model that gets referenced repeatedly
- Would benefit from MDP branding

**MEDIUM Priority** (screenshot from PDF acceptable):
- Referenced but not filled in
- Supporting concept, not core
- One-time use

**LOW Priority** (text description only):
- Example/illustration only
- Context-specific to book's examples
- Decorative

## Recreation Notes

### For HIGH Priority Items
1. Use MDP brand colors and chevron design language where appropriate
2. Create both PDF and interactive web versions
3. Include clear instructions on each template
4. Test with students for usability
5. Consider fillable digital versions (PDF forms or web apps)

### Design Considerations
- Maintain spirit of "rough and ready" — templates shouldn't feel too polished
- Leave adequate white space for student work
- Use clear, legible fonts at poster-printing sizes
- Include attribution to Liedtka source
