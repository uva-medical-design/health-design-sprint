# Step 13: Get Feedback from Stakeholders

Stakeholder or customer co-creation is the process of engaging potential stakeholders in concept development. Put rough prototypes in front of them, observe reactions, and use results to iterate toward an improved concept.

## Core Concept

If you want innovations to be meaningful to those you're trying to create value for, invite them into your process. In our Six Sigma world that values perfection and polish, showing unfinished "stuff" can feel uncomfortable — but customers have the most to teach you.

### The Sooner, The Better
The sooner you get something in front of stakeholders that they can react to, the faster you'll get to a differentiated value-added solution. And they will love being involved.

## Six Principles for Co-Creation

### 1. Enroll Stakeholders Who Care
Find people you trust (they'll see your future plans) who are hungry for a solution and motivated to be completely candid.

### 2. Diversity = Security
Enroll a diverse group. You may be surprised that non-targets are just as keen for what you have to offer.

### 3. Create a No-Selling Zone
Co-creation is NOT an opportunity to "sell" your solution. Rule of thumb: **stakeholder should do 80% of the talking**. You want candid feedback, not false agreement.

### 4. Engage One Stakeholder at a Time
This seems inefficient, but you learn much more when there's no social pressure — when they're alone with you and not influenced by others.

### 5. Offer a Menu of Choices
Presenting a single concept defies the purpose. Give stakeholders 2-3 options and invite them to explore one they're drawn to.

### 6. Expect Multiple Rounds
A typical co-creation phase has three rounds, each reflecting changes learned in previous rounds.

## The Co-Creation Process

### Before the Session
1. Prepare prototypes (usually storyboards)
2. Write a discussion guide with questions for each story panel
3. Identify key assumptions you want to test

### During the Session
1. Present the prototype
2. Ask questions from your discussion guide
3. Let the stakeholder do most of the talking
4. Invite them to modify the storyboard
5. Document their reactions

### After the Session
1. Photograph any changes made to prototype
2. Reset prototype for next session
3. Debrief using the framework below

## Debriefing Framework

For each co-creation session, capture:

| Element | What to Record |
|---------|----------------|
| **Stimulus** | What you showed to gauge response |
| **Observation** | What they did and said (literal transcript) |
| **Feelings** | What emotions their response signaled |
| **Needs** | Underlying needs indicated by those emotions |
| **Implications** | What this means for the concept |

## Visual: Co-Creation Debrief Template

**Page:** 33
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** MEDIUM

### Visual Description
A template with five rows for Stimulus, Observation, Feelings, Needs, and Implications, with space to document each element after a co-creation session.

## How to Use This Step

1. **Recruit diverse stakeholders** — 12 total across 3 rounds is typical
2. **Prepare storyboards** with discussion guides
3. **Conduct one-on-one sessions** (avoid group dynamics)
4. **Listen more than talk** (80/20 rule)
5. **Offer choices** between concepts
6. **Iterate between rounds** based on feedback
7. **Document everything** using the debrief framework

## Signs You Need This Step

- You have prototypes but no real user feedback
- Team loves the concept but hasn't tested it with outsiders
- Assumptions about user reactions haven't been validated
- Moving toward learning launch but want to reduce risk first

## Common Mistakes

### Selling Instead of Learning
If you're convincing more than listening, you're doing it wrong.

### Only Showing One Concept
Without choices, stakeholders can't show you their preferences.

### Group Sessions
Group dynamics suppress honest feedback. Go one-on-one.

### Not Iterating
If you don't change the prototype between rounds, you're wasting the feedback.

### Only Interviewing "Target" Users
Non-targets may surprise you. Cast a wider net.

### Over-Polished Prototypes
Too polished signals "this is finished" and discourages honest critique.

## Typical Co-Creation Timeline

| Round | Purpose | # of Sessions |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Initial reactions, major flaws | 4 |
| 2 | Refined concept testing | 4 |
| 3 | Final validation | 4 |

After each round, synthesize learnings and iterate prototypes before the next round.

## Output

- Refined prototypes incorporating stakeholder feedback
- Documented feedback organized by the debrief framework
- Confidence in (or reconsideration of) key assumptions
- Concepts ready for Step 14: Learning Launches
