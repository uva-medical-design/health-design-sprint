# Step 15: Design the On-Ramp

When designing a new experience, you naturally focus on how it works when customers use it. But you also have to ask: "How will users get here in the first place?" The on-ramp is how customers learn about the offering, try it out, become regular users, and enlist others.

## Core Concept

The on-ramp must be brainstormed, prototyped, co-created, and iterated just as carefully as the solution it serves. It's not just a page in a PowerPoint deck — it's a critical part of the design.

**Note**: On-ramps aren't just for consumer products. They're equally relevant for adoption of new systems, procedures, and internal services.

## The Adoption Ladder

Think of the on-ramp as a ladder leading your target user to become a zealous advocate:

| Level | Stage | Your Focus |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 7 | **Advocacy** | User actively promotes to others |
| 6 | **Repeat Use** | User returns regularly |
| 5 | **Purchase + Use** | User commits and uses |
| 4 | **Tryout** | User experiments with offering |
| 3 | **Consideration** | User evaluates options |
| 2 | **Understanding** | User comprehends the value |
| 1 | **Awareness** | User knows it exists |

**Key Insight**: Steps 1-15 of this field book have focused primarily on levels 5 and 6. Now shift attention to levels 1-4.

## On-Ramp Strategies

### Social Pressure
Social pressure works. If you want employees to sign up for a wellness program, send enrollment postcards to home addresses so spouses will see and encourage participation.

### Use Artifacts
Provide intriguing artifacts that get noticed. Amazon makes its logo prominent on boxes because many orders ship to workplaces where others will see them.

### Provide Social Capital
Give social recognition to power users. Airline frequent flyer programs turn top flyers into ambassadors. eBay designates "power sellers." These are affordable on-ramps.

### Build in Network Value
Design so users find value in connecting with others. Online photo services enable sharing, which provides a crucial on-ramp for new customers.

### Enable User-Created Content
Let people customize and share their content. LinkedIn depends on people sharing created content as an on-ramp.

### Affordable Giveaways
Nudge prospective users up the on-ramp through giveaways. Starbucks gives "$2 off" coupons for cold beverages after 2PM — an on-ramp to add an afternoon visit.

### Pre-sell Through Social Media
Explore on-ramps before creating a 3D prototype by advertising an early version in social media. Buy Google AdWords or run a LinkedIn campaign to enlist alpha testers.

### Test Alternative On-Ramps
During learning launches, try different on-ramp approaches to see which work best.

## How to Use This Step

1. **Map the adoption ladder** for your concept
2. **Identify current focus** (probably levels 5-6)
3. **Brainstorm on-ramp elements** for levels 1-4
4. **Select promising strategies** from the list above
5. **Prototype on-ramps** just like you prototyped the solution
6. **Test during learning launches**

## Signs You Need This Step

- Concept is great but no one knows about it
- Users who try it love it, but few are trying
- Adoption is slower than expected
- You've focused entirely on the core experience
- Preparing for broader launch

## Common Mistakes

### Treating It as Marketing's Problem
The on-ramp is part of the design, not a separate "marketing" activity.

### Designing On-Ramp Last
It should be brainstormed, prototyped, and tested alongside the core solution.

### One-Size-Fits-All
Different user segments may need different on-ramps.

### Ignoring Internal Adoption
For new systems and procedures, employees need on-ramps too.

### Not Testing
On-ramps need validation just like the core concept.

## On-Ramp Questions to Answer

1. How will target users first become aware of this?
2. How will they understand the value proposition?
3. What will motivate them to try it?
4. How do we reduce friction in the first use?
5. What creates repeat use and habit formation?
6. How do satisfied users become advocates?

## Example On-Ramp Elements

**For an employee wellness program**:

| Ladder Level | On-Ramp Element |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Awareness | Manager announcements, lobby posters |
| Understanding | Testimonial videos from peers |
| Consideration | One-on-one conversations with HR |
| Tryout | No-commitment first week |
| Purchase + Use | Sign-up with health assessment |
| Repeat Use | Weekly check-ins with wellness buddy |
| Advocacy | Recognition for program ambassadors |

## The Learning Loop Continues

Remember: Steps 8-15 represent a learning loop. After designing on-ramps:
- If learning launch shows adoption issues → iterate on-ramp design
- If concept fails to reach users → revisit earlier steps
- If on-ramp works → prepare for broader implementation

## Output

- On-ramp strategy documented
- On-ramp elements ready for testing
- Adoption approach integrated with core concept
- Readiness for implementation or next iteration
