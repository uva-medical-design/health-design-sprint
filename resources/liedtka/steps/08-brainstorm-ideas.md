# Step 8: Brainstorm Ideas

Finally — time to generate solutions! Design thinking requires the deliberate generation of a lot of possibilities. Here are tips to fuel your brainstorming efforts.

## Core Concept

Brainstorming has a bad reputation because it's often done poorly. Successful brainstorming requires the right people, clear focus, proper mind-set, and effective techniques.

## Keys to Successful Brainstorming

### 1. Assemble a Diverse Group
- Small, diverse groups work best
- Go beyond the core project team
- Include people with different perspectives
- Avoid groupthink at all costs

### 2. Work with a Clear Challenge
The brainstorming team must focus on a clearly stated challenge. Your design criteria from Step 7 provide the starting point.

### 3. Encourage the Right Mind-Set
The mind-set you need is that of the **creator, not the critic**.

#### Brainstorming Rules
- One voice at a time
- No filibusters (30 seconds per idea max)
- Show your work (sketches and stick figures)
- Withhold judgment (evaluation comes later)
- Build on the ideas of others
- Have fun!

### 4. Inspire People
People are inspired by people. Show them the human costs of the problem. Use the fieldwork from What Is to create a persona who experiences the problem.

### 5. Select Your Tools
Use at least two brainstorming techniques. See the [Brainstorming Tools](../tools/brainstorming.md) for detailed methods:
- Blue cards and trigger questions
- Analogies / Thief and doctor
- Worst idea
- Contra-logic
- Change perspectives

## The Three-Question Formula

Structure your brainstorm using three trigger questions:

### Question 1: Wide Open
Cover the entire breadth of the opportunity. Surface ideas people have been holding since the beginning. Draw momentum from What Is highlights.

*Example*: "How could we improve the accounts payable process?"

**Bonus**: After Question 1, solicit intentionally bad ideas. This reduces risk threshold and injects fun.

### Question 2: Focused
Focus on one or two specific elements of the design criteria closely linked to user needs. Use simple, broad language.

*Example*: "How could we ensure that everyone understands the accounts payable process from beginning to end?"

### Question 3: Analogical
Draw on a metaphor or analogy. Identify an analogous situation and use it to inspire thinking.

*Example*: "Imagine that our data analytics tools are the librarians of information. What practices of traditional and digital libraries could we adapt?"

## How to Use This Step

1. **Prepare the space** — room with wall space, Post-its, markers
2. **Review design criteria** — post them visibly
3. **Present a persona** — humanize the problem
4. **Use multiple techniques** — don't rely on one method
5. **Capture every idea** — one idea per Post-it
6. **Don't evaluate yet** — that comes in Step 9

## Signs You Need This Step

- You have clear design criteria and are ready to generate solutions
- Your team is stuck on the same few ideas
- You need a large quantity of options before narrowing
- Previous brainstorms felt unproductive

## Common Mistakes

### Evaluating During Brainstorming
The critic kills creativity. Save evaluation for later.

### Relying on Free Association
Unstructured "just shout out ideas" rarely works. Use techniques.

### Homogeneous Groups
Same perspectives yield same ideas. Include outsiders.

### Skipping the Human Connection
Without emotional investment in the problem, ideas stay safe.

### Stopping Too Early
Push past the obvious ideas. The best often come later.

## Quantity Targets

A good brainstorming session with 5 people should generate:
- 80+ unique ideas using blue cards with 5-6 trigger questions
- Variety across different aspects of the design criteria
- Some "wild" ideas alongside practical ones

## Output

You'll end with a sea of Post-it notes — dozens or hundreds of individual ideas. These are the raw materials for Step 9: Develop Concepts.

Think of ideas as individual Legos. Next, you'll build cool creations by combining them in different ways.
