# Step 2: Scope Your Project

Framing a project and refining its scope are crucial for effectively pursuing new opportunities. Use the broader/narrower framework to expand or focus your thinking about your project.

## Core Concept

The right scope sits between too broad (unfocused, overwhelming) and too narrow (missing bigger opportunities). By exploring both directions, you can choose a scope that is actionable with enough possibility to be interesting and enough traction to make progress.

## The Framework: Broader and Narrower

### Start in the Center
Write your current area of opportunity, starting with an action verb.

**Example**: "Help people buy clothes for work"

### Go Broader (Ask "Why does this matter?")
- What's one reason this matters? → Higher-level opportunity
- What's another reason this matters? → Another higher-level opportunity

**Example**: "Help people look and feel great"

### Go Narrower (Ask "What gets in the way?")
- What's one barrier that gets in the way? → More focused opportunity
- What's another barrier? → Another focused opportunity

**Example**: "Help people ensure that online purchases fit"

## Visual: Scoping Framework

**Page:** 9
**Type:** framework
**Recreation Priority:** HIGH

### Visual Description
A vertical diagram with the current opportunity in a center box. Two arrows point upward to broader opportunity boxes, driven by "reasons it matters" questions. Two arrows point downward to narrower opportunity boxes, driven by "barriers" questions.

### Key Elements
- Center box: "START HERE - Current area of opportunity"
- Two upper boxes: Broader areas of opportunity
- Two lower boxes: Narrower areas of opportunity
- Labeled arrows showing the questions that drive expansion/focus
- "Ask yourself" prompts at each transition

### Semantic Tags for This Visual
retrieval_triggers:
  - "show me the scoping framework"
  - "broader narrower template"
  - "how to visualize project scope"
  - "scoping diagram"

situations:
  - Working through project scope with a team
  - Need a visual tool for scope discussion

### Recreation Notes
High priority for recreation. Used Day 1-2 of sprint. Consider making it interactive/fillable. Core to challenge framing.

## How to Use This Step

1. **Write your initial opportunity** in the center, starting with an action verb
2. **Explore broader twice** by asking "What's one reason this matters?"
3. **Explore narrower twice** by asking "What's one barrier that gets in the way?"
4. **Select your scope** that feels actionable, interesting, and achievable
5. **Document your rationale** for the chosen level

## Signs You Need This Step

- Your challenge statement is longer than two sentences
- You're describing a solution, not a problem
- Team members have different interpretations of the project
- You can't identify a specific user or stakeholder
- Everything feels equally important
- You feel paralyzed about where to begin

## Common Mistakes

### Staying Too Broad
"Improve healthcare" — This is too vast to act on. No clear user, no clear outcome.

### Going Too Narrow Too Fast
Jumping to a specific solution space without exploring broader possibilities first.

### Skipping the "Reasons" Exploration
Going narrow without understanding why the broader opportunity matters can lead to solving the wrong problem.

### Writing a Solution as Your Scope
"Create an app for X" is a solution. "Help people do X" is a problem space.

## Good Scope Characteristics

A well-scoped project:
- **Starts with an action verb** (Help, Enable, Improve, Support, etc.)
- **Focuses on a user need**, not a solution
- **Is specific enough** to know when you're done
- **Is broad enough** to allow creative solutions
- **Has a clear user** you can observe and interview

## Example Scoping

**Initial**: "Improving the health of all employees"

**Broader**:
- "Reducing company spending on health care" (one reason it matters)
- "Improving employee engagement and productivity" (another reason)

**Narrower**:
- "Getting management to act as role models for healthy behavior" (one barrier)
- "Increasing participation rate in existing programs" (another barrier)

**Selected Scope**: "Improving the health of all employees through new wellness initiatives" — Broad enough to explore new solutions, narrow enough to have clear stakeholders.

## Tips for Team Alignment

- Have each team member independently write their understanding of the scope
- Compare versions and discuss differences
- Use the broader/narrower framework together
- Agree on a single scope statement before proceeding
