# Step 11: Surface Key Assumptions

Before bringing a napkin pitch to life, surface the key assumptions underlying the concept's attractiveness and use data to assess whether they're true. Any business concept is actually a hypothesis — a well-informed guess.

## Core Concept

Projects fail because reality turns out to be different than expected. Launching new concepts to see if they work is risky and expensive. Minimize risk by testing assumptions before full investment.

## The Four Tests

Evaluate your concept against four dimensions:

### 1. Value Test
**Key Question**: Will stakeholders want this?

Assumptions to examine:
- Customers want it
- Customers will pay for it
- Partners want it

### 2. Execution Test
**Key Question**: Can we deliver this?

Assumptions to examine:
- We can produce the experience technically
- We can acquire customers
- We can operate the business as it grows

### 3. Scale Test
**Key Question**: Can this be a big enough opportunity?

Assumptions to examine:
- Addressable market is big enough
- We can acquire customers affordably
- Revenues exceed costs at scale

### 4. Defensibility Test
**Key Question**: Can we sustain advantage?

Assumptions to examine:
- We can protect our advantage
- Advantage increases as we grow

## Test Strategy: Three Levels

Different assumptions need different testing approaches, in order of increasing cost and risk:

### Level 1: Thought Experiments (TE)
- Learn through analysis of existing data
- Typical time frame: 1-2 days
- No exposure to third parties required

**Best for**: Assumptions where data already exists

### Level 2: 2D & 3D Simulation Experiments
- Learn through dialog with market participants using storyboards or prototypes
- Typical time frame: 1-2 weeks
- May require exposing intentions to selected participants

**Best for**: Assumptions about user reactions and preferences

### Level 3: Live (4D) In-Market Experiments
- Test via a live experience of the offering
- Typical time frame: 30-90 days
- Requires exposing offering to many participants

**Best for**: Assumptions about actual behavior (not stated preferences)

## Visual: Key Assumptions Matrix

**Page:** 29
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** HIGH

### Visual Description
A matrix with four rows (Value, Execution, Scale, Defensibility tests) and columns for listing assumptions and marking test strategy (TE, 2D/3D, 4D).

### Key Elements
- Four test categories as row headers
- Columns for assumptions and test type selection
- Checkboxes or indicators for test approach
- Space for multiple assumptions per category

### Semantic Tags for This Visual
retrieval_triggers:
  - "assumption testing template"
  - "key assumptions matrix"
  - "how to test assumptions"

situations:
  - Systematically identifying concept risks
  - Planning validation activities

### Recreation Notes
High priority. Critical for de-risking concepts before investment.

## How to Use This Step

1. **For each napkin pitch**, work through the four tests
2. **List 2-3 key assumptions** per test category
3. **Prioritize by importance** — which assumptions are "make or break"?
4. **Set test strategy** — which level of testing for each assumption?
5. **Start with thought experiments** — test what you can with existing data
6. **Plan 2D/3D experiments** for remaining critical assumptions

## The Testing Principle

Always use the **lowest-cost, lowest-risk approach** to get the job done, starting with your most critical assumptions.

## Signs You Need This Step

- Concepts look good on paper but you're not sure they'll work
- Team has different beliefs about what will succeed
- You need to decide which concepts to prototype
- Stakeholders ask "how do you know this will work?"
- Preparing for learning launches

## Common Mistakes

### Skipping Thought Experiments
Jumping to expensive testing when existing data could answer the question.

### Testing Nice-to-Know vs. Must-Know
Focus on "make or break" assumptions, not interesting-but-not-critical ones.

### Only Testing Value
Ignoring execution, scale, and defensibility until too late.

### Confirmation Bias
Designing tests to get the answers you want, not the truth.

### Testing Too Late
Waiting until significant investment has been made.

## Example Assumptions

**Concept**: "Wellness Buddy System"

| Test | Key Assumptions |
|------|-----------------|
| **Value** | Employees want accountability partners; Pairs will actually check in weekly |
| **Execution** | We can match people effectively; Platform can support pairing feature |
| **Scale** | Enough employees will participate to create good matches; Cost per participant is sustainable |
| **Defensibility** | Culture of mutual support is hard to copy; Network effects create stickiness |

## Revisit and Refine

Key assumptions become a reference point for the rest of the project. Revisit them after:
- Step 13: Stakeholder Feedback
- Step 14: Learning Launches

Update assumptions based on what you learn.
