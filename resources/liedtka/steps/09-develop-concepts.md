# Step 9: Develop Concepts

Concept development is the act of choosing the best ideas from brainstorming and assembling them into an array of detailed solutions. Build multiple concepts so you can offer choice to your stakeholders.

## Core Concept

Think of your ideas as individual Legos — now it's time to build cool creations by combining them in different ways.

### The Cooking Analogy
Most teams conclude brainstorming by selecting favorite ideas from the sea of Post-its. This is like a chef taking the best vegetables from the farmers' market and dumping them all in a pot without selecting combinations that work together, washing, slicing, dicing, and seasoning.

To get the most from your ideas, you need to do prep work.

## Concept Development Methods

Choose one or try all four:

### 1. Anchors
**Use when**: You notice big themes in your brainstormed ideas.
**What it does**: Takes a few ideas from lukewarm to sizzling by playing up key dimensions.
**See**: [Anchors Tool](../tools/anchors.md)

### 2. Bring-Build-Buy Map
**Use when**: You need to think about how to produce and deliver the concept.
**What it does**: Highlights what you'll bring (existing assets), build (new capabilities), or buy (through partners).
**See**: [Bring-Build-Buy Map](../tools/bring-build-buy-map.md)

### 3. Forced Connections
**Use when**: You want serendipity to stretch your thinking.
**What it does**: Exercises your concept development muscle by forcing unexpected combinations.
**See**: [Forced Connections](../tools/forced-connections.md)

### 4. Combinatorial Play
**Use when**: You want to systematically explore all possibilities.
**What it does**: Mix-and-match "ingredients" of ideas to ensure you don't miss any opportunity.
**See**: [Combinatorial Play](../tools/combinatorial-play.md)

## Why Multiple Concepts Matter

### Don't Pick a Winner Yet
Choosing a single concept in the conference room is a mistake. Many high-potential concepts end up in the trash this way.

### Let Users Choose
Design thinking is user-driven. Empower users to consider multiple concepts and shape what emerges.

### Strong Alternatives
Well-chosen anchors ensure you provide genuine choices to customers during co-creation, not just variations on a single theme.

## How to Use This Step

1. **Review all brainstormed ideas** — spread them out
2. **Look for themes and clusters** — group related ideas
3. **Select a concept development method** (or try multiple)
4. **Build 3-5 distinct concepts** — each should be genuinely different
5. **Document each concept** — prepare for napkin pitches

## Signs You Need This Step

- Brainstorming produced many ideas but no coherent solutions
- Team wants to jump to a single favorite idea
- Ideas feel incomplete or one-dimensional
- You need something substantial to show stakeholders

## Characteristics of Good Concepts

### A Good Concept:
- Combines multiple ideas into a coherent whole
- Addresses multiple design criteria
- Is distinct from other concepts (not just a variation)
- Can be explained in a few sentences
- Is complete enough to prototype

### A Concept Is NOT:
- A single idea
- A vague direction
- A slight variation of another concept
- A solution to only one aspect of the problem

## From Ideas to Concepts: Example

**Individual Ideas** (from brainstorming):
- Mobile app for tracking
- Peer support groups
- Manager coaching
- Gamification points
- Health challenges
- Personalized goals

**Concept A** — "Team Challenge": Gamified team competitions with manager coaching, tracking progress through mobile app

**Concept B** — "Personal Journey": Personalized goals with peer support groups, no competition element

**Concept C** — "Manager-Led Wellness": Manager coaching central, team activities, corporate recognition

Each concept is a distinct approach combining different ideas.

## Common Mistakes

### Picking One Winner
The temptation to choose early denies stakeholders genuine choice.

### Making Concepts Too Similar
If concepts are just variations on a theme, you haven't explored enough.

### Ignoring Some Ideas
Give unexpected or "wild" ideas a chance to be combined into concepts.

### Concept = Single Idea
A concept should combine multiple ideas into a coherent solution.

### Not Enough Concepts
Aim for at least 3 concepts. 5 is better. You can always narrow later.

## Output

By the end of this step, you should have 3-5 distinct concepts ready for Step 10: Create Napkin Pitches.
