# Step 5: Do Your Research

You've made your plans. Now it's time to dive in and begin exploring What Is. First, you'll gather data using the methods from your research plan.

## Core Concept

Design thinking research is about human-scale data—individual stories about people, their needs, and how they relate to your opportunity. This is different from traditional market research that compiles surveys and statistics.

## Research Method Selection Guide

### Starting Point: Secondary Research
**Use when**: You need to familiarize yourself with the landscape and identify major trends.
**What it provides**: Background context, industry trends, existing knowledge.
**Tool reference**: [Secondary Research](../tools/secondary-research.md)

### To See Reality: Direct Observation
**Use when**: You want to see what people actually do (not just what they say).
**What it provides**: Behavioral insights, environmental context, unexpected discoveries.
**Tool reference**: [Direct Observation](../tools/direct-observation.md)

### To Understand Thinking: Ethnographic Interviews
**Use when**: You need to understand attitudes, beliefs, motivations, and hidden needs.
**What it provides**: Deep insights into how people think and feel.
**Tool reference**: [Ethnographic Interviews](../tools/ethnographic-interviews.md)

### For Specific Insights

| If you need to... | Use this tool |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Pinpoint unmet needs | [Job to Be Done](../tools/job-to-be-done.md) |
| Analyze value creation | [Value Chain Analysis](../tools/value-chain-analysis.md) |
| Map a process/journey | [Journey Mapping](../tools/journey-mapping.md) |
| Understand user segments | [Personas](../tools/personas.md) |
| Build deep empathy | [360 Empathy](../tools/360-empathy.md) |

## Recommended Approach

**Use at least two research methods** to get richer data. Common combinations:

1. **Secondary Research + Ethnographic Interviews**: Start with background context, then go deep with users.

2. **Direct Observation + Ethnographic Interviews**: See what people do, then understand why.

3. **Journey Mapping + Personas**: Map the experience, then characterize different user types.

## How to Use This Step

1. **Execute your research plan** from Step 4
2. **Start with secondary research** to get the lay of the land
3. **Conduct observations and interviews** to gather human-scale data
4. **Document everything** — notes, quotes, photos, artifacts
5. **Process data with synthesis tools** (journey maps, personas, 360 empathy)

## Getting Unstuck

Research often stalls. Common blockers and solutions:

### "I can't find people to interview"
- Return to your people plan — who in your network can help?
- Ask existing contacts for introductions
- Find communities where your users gather
- Consider recruiting through partners

### "I don't have time/resources"
- Start small — even 3-5 interviews provide insights
- Use quick observation sessions
- Leverage existing data you already have

### "I'm nervous about talking to strangers"
- Practice with friendly contacts first
- Remember: most people enjoy being asked about their experiences
- Use a structured interview guide for confidence

### "I don't know what to ask"
- Focus on stories, not opinions
- Ask about specific past experiences
- Use "tell me about a time when..." prompts

## Signs You're Ready for Step 6

- You have data from each relevant stakeholder group
- You've talked to both current users and non-users
- You have rich stories, not just statistics
- You're eager to start making sense of what you've learned

## Key Research Principles

### Quality Over Quantity
8-20 thoughtful interviews beats 100 shallow surveys.

### Stories Over Opinions
"Tell me about the last time you..." reveals more than "What do you think about...?"

### Actions Over Words
What people do often differs from what they say they do. Observe behavior.

### Document Artifacts
Photos, tools people use, their environment — these provide context for later sense-making.

## Common Mistakes

### Skipping Secondary Research
Not building on what's already known wastes time rediscovering existing insights.

### Only Interviewing Friendly Contacts
You need diverse perspectives, including people who challenge your assumptions.

### Not Documenting in Real Time
Waiting to write up notes means losing details. Document immediately.

### Rushing to Conclusions
Resist interpreting while gathering data. Just collect — sense-making comes next.

### Stopping Too Early
Keep going until you start hearing similar stories. Saturation indicates enough data.

## A Sea of Data

After research, you'll have mountains of notes, quotes, and observations. This is good! Step 6 will help you make sense of it all. The key is that this data is only as good as what you can learn from it.
