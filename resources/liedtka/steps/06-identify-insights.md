# Step 6: Identify Insights

Now it's time to look for patterns and insights in the data you've collected. The goal is to establish criteria for idea generation in the What If stage.

## Core Concept

Insights are not handed to you by stakeholders. They emerge as you pore over information, looking for patterns. This is often the most difficult part of the design process — but also the most rewarding.

### Insight vs. Observation
- **Observation**: "Smokers ages 25-35 don't think of smoking as an addiction"
- **Insight**: "They view it as a temporary lifestyle choice"
- **Reframe**: "Support me as I make a new lifestyle choice" (not "Help me overcome my addiction")

## The Mind Mapping Process

Structure a team process for identifying insights. This creates a "common mind" — aligned understanding of What Is.

### Step 1: Create a Gallery
Put large visuals of your learnings on the walls:
- Journey maps
- Persona 2x2s
- Value chains
- Interview summaries
- Any other data posters

### Step 2: Individual Browsing
Each team member browses the gallery silently and notes data that should inform thinking:
- Write one piece of data per Post-it note
- Write specifics, not interpretations
- Use phrases, not single words
- Write legibly in block letters

### Step 3: Cluster the Data
**Individual sorting** (5 minutes):
- Each person privately sorts their Post-its into related piles

**Group clustering**:
- One person shares a Post-it, reads it aloud, sticks it on shared board
- Others contribute related Post-its, reading each aloud
- Second person starts a new cluster
- Continue until all Post-its are placed

### Step 4: Identify Insights
For each cluster:
1. **Label it** — what is this cluster about? (e.g., "technology")
2. **Push to "So What"** — transform labels into themes (e.g., "Technology makes it harder for people to do their jobs")
3. **Write insights** on larger Post-its and place on clusters
4. **Allow multiple insights per cluster** if data suggests different things

## What Makes a Good Insight?

### Characteristics of Strong Insights
- Reveals something hidden or unexpected
- Connects to human emotions or motivations
- Points toward opportunities
- Challenges existing assumptions
- Can be translated into design criteria

### Characteristics of Weak "Insights"
- Restates the obvious
- Is just a data summary
- Doesn't reveal anything actionable
- Is too abstract to act on

## The Reframe

A good reframing helps your team see possibilities that were always there but were hidden from view.

### Example Reframes

| Initial Frame | Reframe |
|---------------|---------|
| "Help me overcome my chemical addiction" | "Support me as I make a new lifestyle choice" |
| "Help me find the right product" | "Help me feel confident in my choice" |
| "Make checkout faster" | "Reduce the anxiety of waiting" |

### How to Find Your Reframe
1. Review all your insights
2. Look for connections between them
3. Ask: "What's the hidden truth about what users want?"
4. Express this as a new way to see the opportunity

## Visual: Mind Map Example

**Page:** 19
**Type:** process
**Recreation Priority:** MEDIUM

### Visual Description
A whiteboard or wall covered with Post-it notes arranged in clusters. Larger Post-its with insight statements sit atop each cluster. Lines or spacing separate different theme areas.

### Key Elements
- Multiple clusters of small Post-its
- Larger "insight" Post-its on top of clusters
- Visual separation between themes
- Handwritten, organic appearance

## Signs You're Ready for Step 7

- You have 4-8 clear insights
- Each insight goes beyond surface observations
- You can articulate a reframe
- Team is aligned on the key findings
- You're excited to start generating ideas

## Common Mistakes

### Clustering Too Early
Writing interpretations before capturing all the data. Capture first, interpret second.

### Stopping at Labels
"Technology" is a label. "Technology creates barriers to human connection" is an insight.

### Forcing Consensus
Allowing disagreement can reveal important tensions. Not every cluster needs unanimous agreement.

### Missing the Emotional
Focusing only on functional needs and missing emotional, social, or psychological drivers.

### Skipping the Gallery Walk
Trying to synthesize without visual display loses the benefit of collective sense-making.

## Tips for Insight Sessions

- **Use a large space** — you need wall room
- **Set time limits** — prevent overthinking during browsing
- **Read aloud** — hearing data helps pattern recognition
- **Embrace messiness** — the process is nonlinear
- **Take photos** — document your clusters and insights

## Bonus: Cycle Back to Design Brief

After identifying insights, revisit your design brief. Can you better reframe the opportunity through the lens of what you've learned about users?
