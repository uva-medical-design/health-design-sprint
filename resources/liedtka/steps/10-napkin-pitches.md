# Step 10: Create Napkin Pitches

The napkin pitch provides a simple, consistent format for summarizing and communicating new concepts. The name derives from the notion that a good idea can (and should) be communicated simply — so simply that it would fit on the back of a napkin.

## Core Concept

Use the napkin pitch at the conclusion of concept development to summarize concepts coming out of What If that you want to explore further in What Wows.

**Target**: At least 3 napkin pitches before moving forward. Experienced design thinkers often explore a dozen.

## The Napkin Pitch Template

### Concept Name
Give your concept a memorable name.

### The Big Idea
Describe the concept in a few sentences. What is it?

### Needs/Benefits
- What stakeholder wants this?
- What unmet needs does it serve?
- How will the stakeholder benefit?

### Execution
- How will we deliver?
- What asset or capability does this leverage or require?
- What partners do we need?

### Business Rationale
- How will this address the opportunity defined in our design brief?
- What makes us uniquely capable of delivering this?
- How will our competition react?
- How will we sustain our advantage?

## Visual: Napkin Pitch Template

**Page:** 27
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** HIGH

### Visual Description
A single-page template divided into four quadrants: The Big Idea (top left), Needs/Benefits (top right), Execution (bottom left), Business Rationale (bottom right). A header section contains the Concept Name.

### Key Elements
- Four-quadrant layout
- Concept name header
- Prompting questions in each section
- Single-page format

### Semantic Tags for This Visual
retrieval_triggers:
  - "napkin pitch form"
  - "concept summary template"
  - "one-page concept format"

situations:
  - Documenting a concept for stakeholder review
  - Comparing multiple concepts side by side

### Recreation Notes
High priority. This is a working document used throughout What Wows. Consider digital/fillable version and branded design.

## How to Use This Step

1. **Complete one napkin pitch per concept** from Step 9
2. **Use consistent format** so concepts can be compared
3. **Keep it simple** — if it doesn't fit on one page, simplify
4. **Prepare at least 3** different napkin pitches
5. **Review against design criteria** — does each concept address them?

## What Makes a Good Napkin Pitch

### Clear and Concise
If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

### Stakeholder-Focused
Leads with user needs, not technical features.

### Actionable
Clear enough that someone could start prototyping.

### Differentiating
Shows what makes this concept different from alternatives.

### Honest About Execution
Acknowledges what capabilities are needed and who partners might be.

## Signs You Need This Step

- You have developed concepts but haven't documented them consistently
- Stakeholders ask "what exactly is your idea?"
- Team members describe the same concept differently
- You need to compare concepts systematically
- Preparing for assumption testing

## Common Mistakes

### Too Much Detail
The napkin pitch is a summary, not a business plan. Keep it brief.

### Skipping User Needs
Leading with the solution instead of who it's for and why they want it.

### Vague Execution
"We'll figure it out" doesn't inspire confidence. Be specific about how.

### Ignoring Competition
Pretending competitors don't exist or won't respond.

### Making Them All Similar
If napkin pitches look the same, your concepts aren't distinct enough.

## Example Napkin Pitch Elements

**Concept Name**: "Wellness Buddy System"

**The Big Idea**: Pair employees with peers for mutual accountability on health goals. Pairs choose their own focus area and check in weekly through a simple app.

**Needs/Benefits**:
- Target: Employees who want to improve health but lack motivation
- Unmet need: Social support and accountability
- Benefit: Better results through partnership, plus social connection

**Execution**:
- Leverage: Existing wellness platform
- Build: Matching algorithm and simple check-in feature
- Partner: Behavioral health expert for program design

**Business Rationale**:
- Addresses participation gap in current programs
- Low cost — peers support each other
- Builds culture of mutual support
- Competition unlikely to replicate our culture

## Using Napkin Pitches

### For Comparison
Lay out all napkin pitches and compare across dimensions:
- Which best addresses user needs?
- Which is most feasible?
- Which is most differentiated?

### For Stakeholder Communication
Share napkin pitches with sponsors, partners, or leadership to get input on which concepts to pursue.

### For Assumption Testing
Each napkin pitch implies assumptions. Step 11 will surface these explicitly.

## Output

3-5 completed napkin pitches ready for Step 11: Surface Key Assumptions.
