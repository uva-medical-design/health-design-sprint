# Step 4: Make Your Plans

Every challenge is different, so take time to develop a custom plan. Think about your time frame, which tools to use, who will help, and where you'll work.

## Core Concept

There are three elements to plan explicitly:
1. **Activities**: What tools you'll use and what you'll do
2. **People**: Stakeholders and supporters you'll rely on
3. **Research**: How you'll gather data to inform your work

## The Project Plan

Map your journey through the four questions by selecting which tools and steps you'll use.

### Before You Begin
- Step 1: Identify an Opportunity
- Step 2: Scope Your Project
- Step 3: Draft Your Design Brief
- Step 4: Make Your Plans (you are here)

### What Is Phase
- Step 5: Do Your Research
  - Secondary research
  - Direct observation
  - Ethnographic interviews
  - Job to be done
  - Value chain analysis
  - Journey mapping
  - Personas
  - 360 empathy
  - Creating posters
- Step 6: Identify Insights
- Step 7: Establish Design Criteria

### What If Phase
- Step 8: Brainstorm Ideas
  - Blue cards and trigger questions
  - Analogies / Thief and doctor
  - Worst idea
  - Contra-logic
  - Change perspectives
- Step 9: Develop Concepts
  - Anchors
  - Bring-build-buy map
  - Forced connections
  - Combinatorial play
- Step 10: Create Napkin Pitches

### What Wows Phase
- Step 11: Surface Key Assumptions
- Step 12: Make Prototypes
  - Visualization basics
  - Storytelling
  - Storyboarding

### What Works Phase
- Step 13: Get Feedback from Stakeholders
  - Co-creation tools
- Step 14: Run Learning Launches
- Step 15: Design the On-Ramp

## The People Plan

Think about human beings who are the target of your efforts or whose help you need.

### Who to Consider
- Customers (internal and external)
- Colleagues
- Partners
- Decision makers
- Thought leaders
- Competitors

### For Each Key Stakeholder, Ask:

1. **What is their current point of view?** How will their behavior need to be different to address the challenge?

2. **What am I curious about?** What do I want to understand about this stakeholder?

3. **How can I develop empathy?** What experiences can help me see the world from their perspective?

## Visual: People Plan Template

**Page:** 14
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** MEDIUM

### Visual Description
A worksheet with three columns for three different stakeholders. Each column has spaces for: Name/Role, Current POV, Curiosity questions, and Empathy development strategies.

### Key Elements
- Three stakeholder columns
- Fields for name, current perspective, curiosity, empathy building
- Space for notes on relationship status

## The Research Plan

Design thinking inspiration comes from human-scale data—individual stories about people, their needs, and how they relate to your opportunity.

### Research Plan Questions

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Who or what will we study? | |
| Where will we find them? | |
| What questions/issues will we explore? | |
| Number of observations/interviews? | |
| When will research happen? | |
| Who on the team is responsible? | |

## Visual: Research Plan Template

**Page:** 15
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** HIGH

### Visual Description
A table with six columns (Who/What, Where, Questions, Number, When, Who responsible) and multiple rows for different research activities.

  - "how to organize research"

## How to Use This Step

1. **Review all tools** in the field book to familiarize yourself with options
2. **Select tools for each phase** based on your specific challenge
3. **Identify key stakeholders** and plan how to engage them
4. **Create your research plan** with specific targets and timelines
5. **Assign responsibilities** if working with a team

## Practical Considerations

### Time Frame
- Consider realistic timelines for each phase
- Plan buffer time for unexpected discoveries

### Team Composition
- The more diverse the team, the better (especially for What Is and What If)
- Include people with different perspectives and expertise

### Physical Space
- A "war room" where you can hang posters helps
- Visual display of findings aids collaboration

### Getting Started
The sooner the better! Don't over-plan — you'll learn by doing.

## Signs You Need This Step

- You're eager to start but don't know the first step
- Team members are working on different things
- No one knows who should do what
- You haven't thought about who to interview
- You're not sure which tools to use

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Planning
Spending too much time planning and too little time doing. Planning is valuable but don't let it become procrastination.

### Under-Planning
Jumping into research without thinking about whom to talk to or what to ask.

### Forgetting Stakeholder Relationships
Not considering how to approach people or who can make introductions.

### Ignoring Team Dynamics
Not assigning clear responsibilities or leveraging diverse skills.

## Tips for Success

- **Read ahead** through the steps and tools before planning
- **Start with empathy** — plan to understand people first
- **Use at least two research methods** for richer data
- **Build your network** — consider who can connect you to users
- **Stay flexible** — adjust plans as you learn
