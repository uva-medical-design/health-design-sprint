# Step 3: Draft Your Design Brief

A well-constructed project process is rooted in a design brief that clarifies scope, intent, key questions, and target stakeholders. The brief keeps you focused and drives ambiguity out of project management.

## Core Concept

Even though the environment is full of uncertainty, the management of your design project doesn't need to be. Since key elements of design are uncontrollable, it's all the more important to get clarity, control, and transparency into managing the project itself.

## The Design Brief Template

### Project Description
Describe the project in a few sentences, as you would in an "elevator pitch."
- What problem or opportunity are you addressing?
- Why does it matter?

### Scope
- What is within scope and what is outside it?
- What efforts sit adjacent to this project?

### Constraints
- What constraints must you work within?
- What requirements must a successful solution meet?

### Target Users
- Who are you designing for?
- Be as specific as possible
- Whom do you need to understand?
- Why are they important?

### Exploration Questions
- What key questions will you answer through research?
- What are you curious to learn about stakeholders?
- What needs do you need to understand better?
- What emerging possibilities should you explore?

### Expected Outcomes
What outcomes would you like to see?

### Success Metrics
How will you measure success?

## Visual: Design Brief Template

**Page:** 11
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** HIGH

### Visual Description
A single-page form with seven labeled sections: Project Description, Scope, Constraints, Target Users, Exploration Questions, Expected Outcomes, and Success Metrics. Each section has space for writing responses.

### Key Elements
- Seven distinct sections with clear headers
- Adequate space for written responses
- Clean, professional layout
- Two-page format recommendation

### Semantic Tags for This Visual
retrieval_triggers:
  - "design brief form"
  - "project planning template"
  - "show me the design brief template"

situations:
  - Need to document project scope and intent
  - Creating alignment document for team

### Recreation Notes
High priority. This is a core working document. Consider digital/fillable version. Should be limited to two pages to stay concise.

## How to Use This Step

1. **Start with your scoped opportunity** from Step 2
2. **Fill in each section** of the brief thoughtfully
3. **Limit to two pages** — forces conciseness
4. **Share with key stakeholders** for alignment
5. **Treat it as living document** — update as understanding evolves

## Signs You Need This Step

- Team members describe the project differently
- Stakeholders don't understand what you're working on
- You can't explain the project in under two minutes
- Success criteria are unclear
- You're not sure who you're designing for

## Key Principles

### Keep It Concise
Two pages maximum. If you can't summarize it briefly, you don't understand it well enough.

### Make It a Living Document
The design brief should evolve as your understanding deepens. It's a work in progress, not a contract.

### Focus on Questions, Not Answers
The Exploration Questions section is crucial — it guides your research and keeps you curious.

### Be Specific About Users
"Everyone" is not a target user. Be specific about whom you're designing for and why.

## Common Mistakes

### Writing a Solution Brief
Describing what you'll build instead of what problem you'll solve.

### Being Too Vague
"Improve the experience" doesn't give direction. What experience? For whom? How will you know?

### Setting Unmeasurable Metrics
"Make users happy" can't be measured. "Increase user satisfaction scores by 20%" can.

### Forgetting Constraints
Real projects have budget, time, technology, and regulatory constraints. Acknowledge them upfront.

### Listing Too Many Target Users
If everyone is a target user, no one is. Prioritize the most important stakeholders.

## Example: MRU Wellness Design Brief

**Project Description**: Improve the health of MRU employees to manage health care costs, increase productivity, and live MRU values.

**Scope**:
- Initial focus on US sites with 500+ employees
- Focus on existing employees (recruiting is out of scope)

**Constraints**:
- Comply with union/labor agreements
- Enable participation for all shifts
- Maximum incremental budget of $250K

**Target Users**: MRU employees and their families, with particular focus on current non-participants

**Exploration Questions**:
- Why do employees participate/not participate?
- What barriers need to be addressed?
- What are best practices?
- What drives cost/health outcomes?

**Expected Outcomes**: Improved engagement, better health outcomes, reduced premiums

**Success Metrics**:
- ROI of at least 2:1
- 70% employee participation
- Premium increases under 2% year-on-year

## Tips for Design Brief Success

- Get stakeholder sign-off early
- Post it visibly in your project space
- Reference it when making decisions
- Update it explicitly when scope changes
- Use it to onboard new team members
