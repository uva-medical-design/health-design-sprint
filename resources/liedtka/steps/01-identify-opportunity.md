# Step 1: Identify an Opportunity

Before diving into the four questions, ensure you have the right kind of problem to work on. Design thinking is especially suited to conditions of high uncertainty—a set of methods that manage risk by placing small bets fast.

## Core Concept

Not every challenge is suited for design thinking. For operational challenges where change is incremental and good historical data exists to predict the future, traditional analytic methods may be more resource-efficient.

## The Framework: Six Questions for Fit Assessment

Evaluate your opportunity against these criteria:

| Question | Design Thinking Fits If... |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Is the problem human-centered? | Deep understanding of actual people is possible and important |
| How clearly do you understand the problem? | You have a hunch but need to explore and get agreement |
| What's the level of uncertainty? | Many unknowns; past data won't predict the future |
| What's the degree of complexity? | Many connecting, interdependent facets; hard to know where to start |
| What data is already available? | Very little relevant existing data to analyze |
| What's your level of curiosity and influence? | Excited to explore; can get people to help |

## How to Use This Step

### 1. Write Down Your Opportunity
Start by capturing the area you want to explore. Don't worry about perfect wording yet.

### 2. Run the Six-Question Assessment
For each question, honestly evaluate whether your opportunity leans toward design thinking or linear analytic methods.

### 3. Validate the Fit
If most answers support design thinking, you have a good candidate. If not, consider:
- Reframing the opportunity to focus on more uncertain aspects
- Using traditional methods for this challenge
- Finding a different opportunity better suited to design thinking

## Signs You Need This Step

- You're excited about an area but can't articulate a specific problem
- Someone told you to "use design thinking" but you're not sure it fits
- You have multiple potential projects and need to choose
- The problem seems too straightforward (might not need design thinking)
- The problem seems too big (might need reframing)

## Common Mistakes

### Jumping to Solutions
Starting with "We need an app that..." instead of understanding the problem space.

### Choosing Safe Problems
Picking challenges where the answer is already known—design thinking won't add value here.

### Choosing Impossible Problems
Selecting challenges outside your sphere of influence or without organizational support.

### Ignoring the Human Element
Focusing on technical or operational problems that don't involve understanding people.

## Example: When Design Thinking Fits

**Zipcar's original challenge**: Creating a new category of transportation service (car rental by the hour with social responsibility)
- High uncertainty ✓
- Human-centered ✓
- Complex, interconnected ✓
- Little existing data ✓

**Zipcar's expansion**: Extending the proven model to university towns
- Lower uncertainty
- Historical data available
- Linear analytic methods more appropriate

## Questions to Ask Yourself

1. Who are the humans at the center of this opportunity?
2. What don't I know that I need to learn?
3. Why hasn't this been solved already?
4. Do I have the curiosity and energy to explore deeply?
5. Will my organization support experimentation?
