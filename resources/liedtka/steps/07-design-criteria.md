# Step 7: Establish Design Criteria

The result of mind mapping is a set of design criteria — a succinct expression of the ideal end state. They describe the ideal qualities or attributes of a great solution, but not the solution itself.

## Core Concept

Design criteria are the bridge between What Is and What If. They translate insights about user needs into requirements that any solution should meet.

### Insight → Criterion Translation
- **Insight**: "Technology makes it hard for people to do their jobs"
- **Design Criterion**: "Uses technology that helps people do their jobs" OR "Only utilizes technology that doesn't get in the way"

## The Translation Process

For each insight from Step 6, ask yourself:

> "If anything were possible, our ideal solution would..."

Then complete that sentence with a criterion.

## Types of Design Criteria

### User Needs
What functional, emotional, psychological, or social needs does the design have to fulfill?
- Why is addressing these needs strategically important?

### User Perceptions
- Aesthetic attributes necessary to succeed with target stakeholders
- Social, ethical, or ecological attributes expected
- What does ease-of-use mean to the target stakeholder?

### Physical Attributes
- Specific environments or situations for use
- Weight or size considerations
- Information capture, storage, or transmission needs

### Functional Attributes
- Specific situations or occasions to accommodate
- Compatibility or standards issues
- Existing processes or procedures to work with

### Constraints
- Completion deadlines
- Budget limitations
- Business constraints (e.g., existing manufacturing base)
- Ecosystem or regulatory concerns

## Visual: Design Criteria Worksheet

**Page:** 21
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** MEDIUM

### Visual Description
A table with five rows (User Needs/Perceptions, Physical Attributes, Functional Attributes, Constraints) and prompting questions in each row to help teams think through criteria comprehensively.

### Key Elements
- Five category sections
- Prompting questions for each category
- Space for writing criteria
- Strategic importance prompts

## How to Use This Step

1. **Review your insights** from Step 6
2. **Translate each insight** into a criterion using "If anything were possible, our ideal solution would..."
3. **Ensure comprehensive coverage** using the criteria categories
4. **Aim for 6-8 criteria** — enough to guide without constraining
5. **Document clearly** for reference during brainstorming

## Example Design Criteria

For an employee wellness challenge:

| Insight | Design Criterion |
|---------|-----------------|
| Employees view health as a personal choice | Respects individual autonomy |
| Time is a major barrier | Fits into existing daily routines |
| Social support helps behavior change | Creates connections between participants |
| One-size-fits-all doesn't work | Allows personalization |
| Privacy concerns prevent participation | Protects personal health information |
| Visible leadership matters | Is endorsed and modeled by management |

## Characteristics of Good Design Criteria

### Good Criteria Are:
- **Solution-agnostic**: Describe outcomes, not specific solutions
- **Measurable**: You can tell if a concept meets them
- **User-focused**: Derived from actual user insights
- **Actionable**: Provide clear direction for ideation
- **Prioritized**: Some may be must-haves, others nice-to-haves

### Avoid Criteria That Are:
- **Too vague**: "Be innovative" doesn't guide anyone
- **Too specific**: "Use a mobile app" is a solution, not a criterion
- **Internally contradictory**: Make sure criteria can coexist
- **Unfounded**: Based on assumptions, not research

## Using Criteria in Brainstorming

Your design criteria become the starting point for Step 8: Brainstorm Ideas.

### As Trigger Questions
"How might we create a solution that [criterion]?"

### As Evaluation Filters
After generating ideas, assess: "Does this idea meet our criteria?"

### As Combination Guides
"Which ideas best address [criterion 1] AND [criterion 2]?"

## Signs You're Ready for Step 8

- You have 6-8 clear design criteria
- Each criterion connects to a user insight
- Criteria are solution-agnostic
- Team agrees these are the right measures of success
- You're excited to start generating ideas that meet these criteria

## Common Mistakes

### Writing Solutions as Criteria
"Create a mobile app" is a solution. "Accessible anywhere, anytime" is a criterion.

### Too Few Criteria
With only 2-3 criteria, you may miss important user needs.

### Too Many Criteria
With 15+ criteria, no solution can satisfy all of them. Prioritize.

### Criteria That Conflict
"Low cost" and "premium experience" may conflict. Acknowledge trade-offs.

### Ignoring Constraints
Forgetting business, regulatory, or technical constraints leads to infeasible ideas.

## Tips for Strong Criteria

- **Post them visibly** during all What If activities
- **Reference them explicitly** when evaluating ideas
- **Allow updates** if new insights emerge
- **Prioritize** — which criteria are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves?
- **Test with stakeholders** — do these criteria resonate with their needs?
