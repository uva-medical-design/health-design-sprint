# Step 12: Make Prototypes

Rapid prototyping is the creation of visual (and sometimes experiential) manifestations of concepts. It's iterative, done quickly, aimed at transforming concepts into feasible, testable models.

## Core Concept

You build prototypes as the next step in assumption testing. In prototyping, you give concepts detail, form, and nuance — you bring them to life.

As Larry Keeley of Doblin describes it: prototyping is "faking a new business fast."

## The Two Roles of Prototypes

### 1. Figure Out WHAT to Build
Early prototypes help clarify the concept itself. Users interact with rough versions, helping you understand what matters.

### 2. Figure Out HOW to Build It
Later, after many iterations, refined prototypes help work out implementation details.

**Start with "what to build" prototypes.** Don't jump to polished versions too early.

## Characteristics of Good Early Prototypes

### Crude and Unfinished
Early prototypes should look like incomplete works in progress. The incompleteness is good — it invites users to interact and improve.

### Feature People
Too often we jump to technical diagrams and process flows. Prototypes need to tell a story and elicit emotional response — put human beings at the center.

### Invite Co-Creation
The goal is to invite the end user to shape the final solution, not to "sell" a finished concept.

## Types of 2D Prototypes

### Flowcharts
Convey the basic building blocks of a new experience.

### Storyboards
Move beyond functional view into the human story of an experience. Focus on the user and the need the experience fills.
**See**: [Storyboarding Tool](../tools/storyboarding.md)

### Metaphorical Prototypes
Elicit a gut reaction and promote dialog without selling specific features.

### Videos
Create the appearance of the service without actually building it.

### Interactive Building Blocks
Enlist users physically in design using mix-and-match drawings or simple digital models.

### Business Concept Illustrations
Express a new experience from multiple perspectives: user experience, technology, and business model.

## How to Use This Step

1. **Select a prototype format** based on your concept type
2. **Emphasize images over words**
3. **Put people at the center** — show users in the experience
4. **Keep it rough** — resist the urge to polish
5. **Prepare for feedback** — prototypes are conversation starters

## Visual: 2D Prototype Workspace

**Page:** 31
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** MEDIUM

### Visual Description
A blank template space for sketching a 2D prototype, with reminders to emphasize images over words and give people a prominent role.

### Key Elements
- Large sketching area
- Prompt reminders around the edges
- Space for user figures/stick people
- Storyboard-style panels optional

## Prototype Selection Guide

| If your concept is... | Consider... |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| A process or journey | Storyboard, flowchart |
| A physical product | 3D mockup, sketch |
| A service experience | Video, role-play |
| A digital interface | Paper prototype, wireframe |
| A business model | Business concept illustration |

## Signs You Need This Step

- Concept is hard to explain verbally
- Stakeholders say "I don't get it"
- Need to test assumptions about user reactions
- Preparing for co-creation sessions
- Team has different mental models of the concept

## Common Mistakes

### Too Polished Too Early
A polished prototype signals "this is finished" and discourages feedback.

### No Humans in the Prototype
Technical diagrams don't elicit emotional reactions. Include people.

### Using It to Sell
Prototypes are for learning, not convincing. Stay open to feedback.

### Only One Version
Create multiple versions to give stakeholders real choices.

### Skipping This Step
Going directly to feedback with only verbal descriptions limits engagement.

## Prototyping Principles

### Just Do It
Start creating before you feel ready. The act of making reveals what you don't know.

### Think Fast and Cheap
The point is to learn quickly. Expensive prototypes slow learning.

### Iterate Rapidly
Expect to make many versions. Each iteration teaches something.

### Make It Feel Real Enough
Users need enough detail to react meaningfully, but not so much that they can't imagine alternatives.

## Output

2D (or 3D) prototypes of your concepts ready for Step 13: Get Feedback from Stakeholders.
