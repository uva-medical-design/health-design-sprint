# Worked Example: MRU Employee Wellness Program

This example shows a complete design thinking project from opportunity identification through research, ideation, and testing. "Metals R Us" (MRU) is a fictional global industrial company.

## Setting the Scene

**Company**: Leading global industrial company
- Annual revenues: $2.5 billion
- Employees: 10,000+
- Recognition: Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For, outstanding safety record

**History of Wellness**: MRU has invested in employee wellness since the 1980s:
- Onsite employee gym at headquarters
- Onsite medical center and pharmacy
- Multiple health care plan options
- Full-time dietician and trainers
- Optional wellness program (managed by external vendor)
- About 50% employee participation

**The Business Case**:
- Wellness delivers 2:1 ROI
- Significantly reduced heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes
- Company values emphasize employee well-being

**The Challenge**: With rising health care costs, leadership wants to:
- Explore new wellness opportunities
- Engage employees who aren't currently participating
- Maintain the values-driven approach (not just cost management)

## Step 1: Design Thinking Fit Assessment

### Is Design Thinking Right?

| Question | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Human-centered? | **Yes** — Understanding employee needs related to health is central |
| Problem clarity? | **Unclear** — We have an objective but don't know which barriers to address |
| Uncertainty? | **High** — Many interconnected elements (insurance, legal, morale, performance) |
| Complexity? | **High** — Many facets, hard to know where to start |
| Data available? | **Some** — Historical data exists but we don't know employee attitudes |
| Curiosity/Influence? | **Yes** — Management team is on board, HR Director leading |

**Conclusion**: Design thinking is appropriate.

## Step 2: Scoping the Project

### Starting Point
"Improving the health of all employees through new wellness initiatives, programs, and/or other activities"

### Broader Opportunities (Why does this matter?)
1. "Reducing our company spending on health care"
2. "Improving employee engagement and productivity"

**Note**: Team wants to keep focus on wellness and values, not just cost management.

### Narrower Opportunities (What barriers exist?)
1. "Getting our entire management team to act as role models for healthy behavior"
2. "Increasing the participation rate in our existing programs"

**Note on #2**: Too limited — not certain existing programs meet everyone's needs.

### Selected Scope
"Improving the health of all employees through new wellness initiatives" — broad enough for new solutions, narrow enough to have clear stakeholders.

## Step 3: Design Brief

### Project Description
Improve the health of MRU employees to manage health care costs, increase productivity, and live the MRU values.

### Scope
- Initial focus on US sites with 500+ employees
- Focus on existing employees (recruiting practices out of scope)

### Constraints
- Comply with union/labor agreements
- Enable participation for all shifts
- Maximum incremental budget of $250K

### Target Users
- MRU employees and their families
- Particular focus on current non-participants

### Exploration Questions
- Why do employees participate/not participate in current programs?
- What barriers to participation need to be addressed?
- What are best practices?
- What are the biggest drivers of cost/health outcomes?

### Expected Outcomes
- Improved engagement and productivity
- Better health outcomes for employees
- Reduced health care premiums

### Success Metrics
- ROI of at least 2:1
- At least 70% of employees participating in at least one program element
- Health care premium increases under 2% year-on-year

## Step 4: People Plan

### Three Key Stakeholder Groups

**Stakeholder #1: Factory Employees**
- Current POV: All over the map — we need to research
- Desired behavior: Take actions to improve health (through MRU programs or not)
- Curious about: Why don't they participate? What barriers? What helps form positive habits?
- Empathy approach: Remember when I started my workout routine — it was tough, I stopped after a few times

**Stakeholder #2: Company Management**
- Current POV: We've made it easy, frustrated that employees don't take advantage. Some managers could be better role models.
- Curious about: Which programs do they personally use? How do they encourage reports? What transformations have they seen?
- Empathy approach: When I tried to do something positive for my family and they didn't appreciate it — made me cynical

**Stakeholder #3: Insurance Reps**
- Current POV: Rates already low, but a few employees have big claims yearly. MRU has maxed out wellness benefits.
- Curious about: How are they impacted by rate changes? What data can they provide? How does MRU compare to other clients?
- Empathy approach: How I feel about customers always asking for more — want to help but gets annoying

**Key Realization**: Need a different approach with management — logical arguments alone may not overcome current perspectives.

## Step 5: Research Plan

| Who/What | Where | Questions | # | When | Who |
|----------|-------|-----------|---|------|-----|
| Participating employees | Sample until enough | Definition of health, programs used, benefits, frustrations | 8 | Next 3 weeks | Team (4 each) |
| Non-participating employees | Sample until enough | Definition of health, barriers, past habit formation, wishes | 8 | Next 3 weeks | Team (4 each) |
| Market research | Online, industry groups, insurance reps | Best practices, trends, policy changes, key health trends | N/A | Next 2 weeks | HR Intern |

## Step 5: Research Execution

### Direct Observation: Employee Gym
**Things to note (general)**:
- How many people come in each hour?
- Which equipment most/least utilized?

**Things to note (per individual)**:
- How long are they there?
- What activities?
- Attitude/demeanor?
- Work or entertainment brought?
- Interaction with others?
- Where is progress stalled?

### Interview Guide Focus
**Topics to explore**:
- What "health" and "wellness" mean to them
- Behaviors associated with health and wellness
- What facilitates or inhibits healthy behaviors

**Interview questions**: Use "tell me more," "what happened then," "what else" to invite deeper sharing.

## Steps 6-7: Insights and Design Criteria

*[Based on synthesized research findings, the team would identify insights and translate them to design criteria. Example patterns from research might include:]*

**Sample Insights**:
- Employees see health as personal choice, not employer's business
- Time is the biggest barrier — work and family leave no room
- Social support helps sustain behavior change
- One-size-fits-all programs don't work for diverse workforce
- Privacy concerns prevent some from participating
- Manager behavior signals what's actually valued

**Sample Design Criteria**:
An ideal solution would...
1. Respect individual autonomy and privacy
2. Fit into existing daily routines
3. Create social connections between participants
4. Allow personalization for different needs
5. Be endorsed and modeled by management
6. Not require significant time commitment

## Steps 8-10: Ideation and Concepts

*[Through brainstorming and concept development, the team would generate and develop multiple concepts. Examples might include:]*

**Concept A: "Wellness Buddy System"**
- Pair employees for mutual accountability
- Pairs choose their own focus area
- Weekly check-ins via simple app
- Recognition for consistent participation

**Concept B: "Micro-Moments"**
- Health tips and challenges integrated into work day
- 5-minute activities requiring no equipment
- Manager-led participation
- Team competitions with modest prizes

**Concept C: "Family Wellness"**
- Extend programs to family members
- Weekend family activities at work facilities
- Family health challenges
- Dependent wellness incentives

## Steps 11-15: Testing and Refinement

*[The team would then surface assumptions, create prototypes, test with stakeholders through co-creation, run learning launches, and design on-ramps for successful concepts.]*

**Sample Key Assumptions to Test (Concept A)**:

| Test | Assumption |
|------|------------|
| Value | Employees want accountability partners; Pairs will actually meet |
| Execution | We can match people effectively; Platform can support it |
| Scale | Enough employees will participate; Cost is sustainable |
| Defensibility | Culture of mutual support is unique to MRU |

## Lessons from This Example

### What Worked Well
1. **Clear scoping** kept the project focused while allowing exploration
2. **Multiple stakeholder perspectives** revealed different angles
3. **Empathy building** helped team understand resistance to change
4. **Research with both participants and non-participants** surfaced barriers

### Key Decisions
1. Focusing on employee wellness (values), not just cost management
2. Starting with US sites 500+ employees before broader rollout
3. Prioritizing current non-participants as target users
4. Including families in scope

### Potential Pitfalls Avoided
1. Assuming "build it and they will come"
2. Treating all employees as having same needs
3. Ignoring manager behavior as barrier
4. Designing without input from non-participants
