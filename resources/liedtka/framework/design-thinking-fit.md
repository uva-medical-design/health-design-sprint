# When to Use Design Thinking

Design thinking is an approach to solving problems especially suited to conditions of high uncertainty. It manages risk by placing small bets fast. However, this approach is not suitable for every challenge.

## The Six Assessment Questions

Use these questions to determine if design thinking is appropriate for your challenge:

### 1. Is the problem human-centered?

| Design Thinking Appropriate | Linear Methods Better |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Deep understanding of actual people (users) is both possible and important | Few human beings are involved in the problem or solution |

**Key insight**: Design thinking excels when you need to understand behaviors, motivations, emotions, and unmet needs of real people.

### 2. How clearly do you understand the problem itself?

| Design Thinking Appropriate | Linear Methods Better |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| You have a hunch about the problem/opportunity but need to explore and get agreement | You understand the problem clearly and are sure you're solving the right one |

**Key insight**: If the problem definition itself is uncertain, design thinking helps explore and frame it correctly.

### 3. What's the level of uncertainty?

| Design Thinking Appropriate | Linear Methods Better |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Many unknowns (large and small); past data is unlikely to help predict the future | The past is a good predictor of the future |

**Key insight**: When you're creating something new or entering unknown territory, design thinking's iterative approach manages risk better than big upfront bets.

### 4. What's the degree of complexity?

| Design Thinking Appropriate | Linear Methods Better |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Many connecting and interdependent facets; hard to know where to start | The path to solving is clear; analytic methods have succeeded with similar problems |

**Key insight**: Complex, interconnected problems benefit from design thinking's exploratory, human-centered approach.

### 5. What data is already available to you?

| Design Thinking Appropriate | Linear Methods Better |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Very little relevant existing data to analyze | Several clear sources of analogous data |

**Key insight**: When you can't analyze your way to an answer because data doesn't exist, design thinking helps you learn by doing.

### 6. What's your level of curiosity and influence?

| Design Thinking Appropriate | Linear Methods Better |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Excited to explore; can get a group of people willing to help | Problem feels routine; must follow existing processes and systems |

**Key insight**: Design thinking requires energy, collaboration, and organizational permission to experiment.

## Visual: Design Thinking Fit Assessment Table

**Page:** 7
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** HIGH

### Visual Description
A two-column table with six rows. The left column header reads "Design thinking is appropriate if..." and the right column header reads "Linear analytic methods may be better if..." Each row contains contrasting conditions for each of the six assessment questions.

### Key Elements
- Six question rows
- Two columns showing contrasting conditions
- Clear visual distinction between design thinking scenarios vs. linear method scenarios
- Checkboxes or space for self-assessment

### Semantic Tags for This Visual
retrieval_triggers:
  - "assessment table for design thinking"
  - "checklist for when to use design thinking"
  - "design thinking fit table"

situations:
  - Evaluating whether a project suits design thinking
  - Justifying methodology choice to stakeholders

### Recreation Notes
High priority - this is a decision-making tool used early in the sprint. Consider making it interactive or as a worksheet.

## Example: Zipcar

The original creation of Zipcar was an ideal fit for design thinking:
- Creating a new category of transportation service
- Car rental by the hour with social responsibility
- High uncertainty, no existing data

However, more than a year after Zipcar proved its model in dense urban contexts, it sought to extend into small university towns. This follow-on challenge could be addressed with more linear analytic methods since operating data from urban markets could help eliminate many unknowns.

**The lesson**: Even within the same organization, different challenges may call for different approaches.

## Common Mistakes

### Using Design Thinking When You Shouldn't
- **Operational optimization**: When you need to improve efficiency of a well-understood process
- **Data-rich decisions**: When extensive historical data clearly points to an answer
- **Compliance requirements**: When regulations dictate the solution
- **Time-critical fixes**: When you need to act immediately on a known problem

### NOT Using Design Thinking When You Should
- **Assuming you know the problem**: Jumping to solutions without exploring current reality
- **Over-relying on past data**: When the context has fundamentally changed
- **Ignoring human factors**: Treating users as data points rather than complex people
- **Fear of uncertainty**: Avoiding exploration because it feels risky

## How to Use This Assessment

1. **Before starting a project**, answer all six questions honestly
2. **If most answers lean toward design thinking**, proceed with the full design thinking process
3. **If answers are mixed**, consider a hybrid approach—use design thinking for the uncertain parts
4. **If most answers lean toward linear methods**, use traditional analytical approaches
5. **Document your reasoning** so you can revisit if the project stalls

## Signs Your Assessment Might Be Wrong

Revisit your methodology choice if:
- You're stuck in analysis paralysis (might need design thinking's action orientation)
- Users reject solutions that looked good on paper (might need more empathy work)
- The "obvious" solution isn't working (might need to reframe the problem)
- Stakeholders can't align on the problem (might need design thinking's exploration)
