# The Four Questions Framework

The Liedtka design thinking process is organized around four fundamental questions that guide teams from understanding current reality to implementing innovative solutions.

## Overview

| Question | Focus | Key Activities |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **What Is?** | Exploration | Research, observation, empathy building |
| **What If?** | Ideation | Brainstorming, concept development |
| **What Wows?** | Selection | Assumption testing, prototyping |
| **What Works?** | Testing | Co-creation, learning launches |

## What Is?

### Purpose
Explore current reality before jumping to solutions. The design process is human-centered and starts with the present, not the future.

### Why It Matters
- Innovative ideas emerge from insights about current reality for real users
- Without these insights, the imagination starves
- Taking time to develop deep insight establishes the reference point for change, the constraints that shape it, and the criteria for success

### Key Activities
1. Identify the right kind of problem for design thinking
2. Create a design brief to move into action
3. Conduct research (secondary, observation, interviews)
4. Build empathy through personas and journey mapping
5. Identify insights that lead to a reframe
6. Establish design criteria

### Output
Design criteria that point toward opportunities that were always there but were hidden. This "reframe" feeds the imagination for What If.

## What If?

### Purpose
Look toward the future and envision new possibilities. This is the creative, generative phase—but it's surprisingly disciplined.

### Why It Matters
- Pushes beyond simplistic expressions of new possibilities
- Arrives at robust concepts that can be evaluated, prototyped, and developed
- Moves from initial brainstorming output to well-developed concepts

### The Creative Challenge
Most people are trained to think critically—to debate and poke holes. This kind of judgment is important, but not yet! Research shows that allowing judging too early drives creative ideas right out the door.

### Key Activities
1. Brainstorm ideas using multiple techniques
2. Develop concepts from individual ideas
3. Create napkin pitches for promising concepts
4. Explore a wide range of possibilities before narrowing

### Output
Multiple robust concepts ready for evaluation and testing.

## What Wows?

### Purpose
Make hard choices by identifying the best concepts—those that "wow"—to guide next steps.

### The Wow Zone
A business concept wows when it sits at the intersection of three criteria:
- **Desirability**: Your targeted stakeholders want it
- **Feasibility**: You are able to produce and deliver it
- **Viability**: Doing so allows your organization to achieve its objectives

### Key Activities
1. Surface key assumptions underlying each concept's attractiveness
2. Identify data needed to test assumptions
3. Create prototypes that allow stakeholder engagement
4. Get high-quality feedback through co-creation

### Output
Refined concepts with tested assumptions, ready for real-world experimentation.

## What Works?

### Purpose
Bring exciting high-potential concepts face-to-face with actual stakeholders in the real world. This is where invention becomes innovation.

### The Critical Distinction
- **Invention**: Doing something in a novel way
- **Innovation**: The invention is implemented and creates value

Invention doesn't necessarily produce better outcomes for real people; only innovation does that.

### Key Activities
1. Run learning launches—experiments in the real world
2. Engage stakeholders in co-creating the solution
3. Iterate based on behavioral data (not just opinions)
4. Design the on-ramp for adoption

### Output
Validated concepts ready for implementation, with evidence of stakeholder value.

## Visual: The Four Questions Diamond

**Page:** 2
**Type:** diagram
**Recreation Priority:** HIGH

### Visual Description
A diamond-shaped diagram showing the four questions arranged in sequence. "What Is?" appears at the top left, "What If?" at the top right, "What Wows?" at the bottom right, and "What Works?" at the bottom left, with a dollar sign indicating the final output/value creation. Arrows connect the questions showing the flow of the process.

### Key Elements
- Four question labels arranged in a diamond pattern
- Directional arrows showing process flow
- "$" symbol indicating business value/outcomes
- Question mark symbols emphasizing the inquiry-based nature

### Semantic Tags for This Visual
retrieval_triggers:
  - "show me the design thinking process"
  - "diagram of four questions"
  - "visual of design thinking framework"
  - "what does the design process look like"

situations:
  - Introducing design thinking to a new team
  - Need a visual reference for where we are in the process

### Recreation Notes
High priority for recreation as branded visual. Consider using MDP chevron design language. Diamond shape emphasizes the iterative/cyclical nature while still showing forward progress.

## The Learning Loop

Steps 8 through 15 represent a learning loop. As confidence in each concept develops:
1. Refine the elements
2. Home in on a path to implementation
3. Each loop represents an affordable investment to reach the next threshold of understanding

This is how design thinking manages risk—through action in the market instead of analytics alone.

## Signs You're Ready to Move Between Phases

### Ready to move from What Is → What If:
- You have representative data from each relevant stakeholder group
- You've identified insights and a compelling reframe
- You have clear design criteria established

### Ready to move from What If → What Wows:
- You have multiple concepts (not just one favorite)
- Concepts are detailed enough to evaluate
- You have napkin pitches for at least 3 concepts

### Ready to move from What Wows → What Works:
- Key assumptions have been identified
- Prototypes have received stakeholder feedback
- You've iterated based on co-creation sessions

### Ready to move from What Works → Implementation:
- Learning launches show positive results
- Critical assumptions have been validated
- On-ramp for adoption is designed
