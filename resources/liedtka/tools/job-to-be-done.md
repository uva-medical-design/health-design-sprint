# Job to Be Done

This tool looks at users' behavior based on underlying needs rather than traditional demographic segmentation. It repositions the question from "What do customers want?" to "What job do they want their purchases to do?"

## Core Concept

A person doesn't want to own a quarter-inch drill — they want to hire a quarter-inch drill to do the job of creating a quarter-inch hole. JTBD helps you understand what motivates customers to seek solutions, identifying gaps in the market.

## Types of Jobs

### Functional Jobs
Tasks to be completed. The practical purpose.

**Example (buying a car)**: "Providing reliable transportation around town"

### Emotional Jobs
Feelings to achieve or experience. Can be:
- **Personal**: How the stakeholder wants to feel about themselves
- **Social**: How the stakeholder wants to be perceived by others

**Example (buying a car)**: "Looking fashionable for my friends"

## The JTBD Framework

| Element | Functional Job | Emotional Job |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Stakeholder's Desired Outcome** | What task do they want accomplished? | What feeling do they want to achieve? |
| **Metric of Success** | How do they measure whether the job is done well? | How do they know they've achieved the feeling? |
| **Outcomes to Avoid** | What negative functional outcomes? | What negative emotional outcomes? |

## Examples

### Buying a Car
| | Functional | Emotional |
|-|------------|-----------|
| Desired Outcome | Reliable transportation around town | Looking fashionable for friends |
| Success Metric | Always available | Number of compliments |
| Outcomes to Avoid | Repair costs, breakdowns | Other people with the same vehicle |

### Shipping a Package
| | Functional | Emotional |
|-|------------|-----------|
| Desired Outcome | Delivering goods to another location | Showing recipient contents are important |
| Success Metric | On time and in good condition | Acknowledgement from recipient |
| Outcomes to Avoid | Late/lost packages, damaged goods | Contents disregarded |

### Hiring an Employee
| | Functional | Emotional |
|-|------------|-----------|
| Desired Outcome | Securing additional resources | Looking like a star on management team |
| Success Metric | Qualified candidate hired | Kudos from boss, end-of-year bonus |
| Outcomes to Avoid | Position vacant, poor performer | Accused of brown-nosing, failure to meet targets |

## How to Use This Tool

1. **Identify needs** that arise in your stakeholders' lives
2. **Think broadly** — beyond your product/service
3. **Consider both functional and emotional jobs**
4. **Define the job statement**: Action verb + object + contextual clarifier
5. **List performance criteria** users use to evaluate solutions
6. **Describe current approaches** and their pain points
7. **Explore benchmarks** from competing/analogous offerings

## Example Job Statement

"A Blackberry helps a business user **make efficient use of small snippets of time**."

Structure: [Solution] helps [user] [action verb] [object] [context]

## The Power of Reframing

When Pfizer observed that smokers ages 25-35 really needed "support in making a new lifestyle choice" (not help with addiction), they identified a different job for Nicorette to do. Nicorette alone wasn't enough — it needed coaching and social support. That reframing led to a new growth platform.

## Signs You Need This Tool

- You know what users buy, but not why
- Current framing isn't revealing opportunities
- Need to understand true motivations
- Want to move beyond demographic segments
- Looking for unmet needs to address

## Common Mistakes

### Stopping at Functional Jobs
Emotional jobs often drive purchase decisions more than functional ones.

### Defining Jobs Too Narrowly
"Buy a drill" vs. "Make a hole" vs. "Hang a picture" — different scopes reveal different opportunities.

### Ignoring Social Jobs
How people want to be perceived matters.

### Not Looking at Pain Points
What's wrong with current solutions tells you where opportunity lies.

## Output

- Documented functional and emotional jobs
- Performance criteria users care about
- Pain points with current solutions
- Foundation for reframing the opportunity
