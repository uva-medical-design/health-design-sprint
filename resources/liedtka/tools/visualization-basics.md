# Visualization Basics

Visualization is fundamental to design thinking at every step. You're envisioning an improved future and relying on collaborators to shape results — visual methods make your thinking accessible to others.

## Core Concept

Artistic skills are NOT required. Not all visualization involves drawing. The point is making thinking visible so others can contribute.

## Forms of Visualization

- Storytelling
- Role-playing
- Poster
- Photo montage
- Flowchart
- Storyboarding
- Video
- Business concept illustration (yes, even PowerPoint)

## Your Visualization Toolkit

- **Field notebook** — constant reference
- **Pencil** — unless you never erase
- **Digital camera** — indispensable
- **Whiteboard** — best on wheels
- **Dry erase markers** — multiple colors
- **Post-it notes** — various sizes and colors
- **Sharpies** — Post-it's best friend
- **Flip-chart paper** — and butcher paper rolls
- **Wall space** — crucial for sharing
- **Windows** — write on them with dry erase!

## Principles for Creating Visuals

### Just Do It
Give up any notion of whether you're "good at drawing." Just start scribbling.

### Fewest Words Wins
Convey ideas using fewest words and labels.

### People First
Put people at the center. Technical diagrams come later.

### Rough and Ready
Should look like you cranked it out quickly.

### Incomplete
Skip details. Leave it unfinished so others can bring their insights.

### Share at "Good Enough"
Don't waste time on artistry. Put it out there.

## Principles for Using Visuals

### Leave Them on Display
Visual communications go on walls where others can see them.

### Invite Co-Authorship
Have Post-its and Sharpies handy. When someone draws over it — you've enabled co-creation!

### Fossil Record
When outdated, don't throw away. Put new version over it. The walls become project history.

## Basic Visual Elements

You only need these elements for simple sketches:

| Element | Use For |
|---------|---------|
| Rectangle | Objects, screens, places |
| Setting (simple background) | Context, environment |
| Stick Figure | People (essential!) |
| Tools (simple shapes) | Objects, devices |
| Speech Bubble | What people say |
| Thought Bubble | What people think |

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Concepts exist only in words
- Team describes ideas differently
- Need to engage stakeholders who aren't present
- Preparing for co-creation sessions
- Want shared visual language

## Common Mistakes

### Waiting Until Perfect
Rough is good. Perfect is slow and discourages input.

### No People
Humans are central to design thinking. Include them.

### All Words, No Images
Even simple sketches communicate faster than paragraphs.

### Hiding Visuals
They need to be visible, not stored in folders.

### Not Inviting Input
The point is co-creation. Make it easy for others to contribute.

## Tips for Non-Artists

- **Stick figures are fine** — even preferred
- **Use rectangles and circles** for everything
- **Label if unclear** — words help simple drawings
- **Trace if needed** — copying isn't cheating
- **Practice makes comfortable** — not necessarily perfect

## Output

- Rough visual representations of concepts
- Accessible prototypes for stakeholder feedback
- Foundation for storyboards and co-creation
