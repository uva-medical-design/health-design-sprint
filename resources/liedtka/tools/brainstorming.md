# Brainstorming Techniques

Use two or three different techniques to fuel your brainstorming. Here are five proven methods.

## Technique #1: Blue Cards and Trigger Questions

Traditional brainstorming gets bogged down by extroverts and rehashed ideas. Blue cards fix this.

### The Process
1. **Develop trigger questions** ranging from familiar to provocative
2. **Present first question** to the group
3. **Silent writing** — each person writes 3+ ideas on blue cards (3 minutes)
4. **Share** — each person reads cards and pins to board without long explanations
5. **Round 2** with same question — builds on Round 1, often yields best ideas
6. **Repeat** with remaining questions

### Why It Works
- Gives introverts a voice
- Offsets "boss effect"
- Generates 3x more ideas than oral brainstorming
- 5 people + 5-6 questions = 80+ unique ideas in 40 minutes

### Example Trigger Questions
- "How will mobile affect this problem?"
- "How could crowdsourcing be used here?"
- Customize to your challenge for best results

## Technique #2: Analogies (Thief and Doctor)

Analogies answer: "Where else do these conditions occur, and what has been done?"

### The Process
1. **List attributes** of your user's circumstances
2. **Brainstorm situations** that share those attributes
3. **Become a "thief"** — steal elements from analogous solutions
4. **"Doctor" them** to fit your context

### Example
Kaiser Permanente wanted to improve nurse medication rounds. One attribute: nurses need 100% concentration during meds but multitask otherwise.

**Analogy**: Airplane pilots (takeoff/landing critical, rest of flight less demanding)

**Stolen concept**: "The sterile cockpit" — no one speaks except about the critical task

### Using the Bull's Eye Template
- Place "User Context" at center with key attributes
- Generate analogies from "mild" (similar) to "wild" (very different)
- Wild analogies often yield the most creative solutions

## Technique #3: Worst Idea

Fear of looking silly inhibits brainstorming. Start with intentionally bad ideas to reduce barriers.

### The Process
1. State objective and design criteria
2. Generate 20+ intentionally bad ideas:
   - Opposite of your objective
   - Extreme or impractical
   - Based on impossible resources
   - Against convention
3. **Flip** each bad idea into a relatively good one
4. Ask: Are any "bad" ideas actually good?

## Technique #4: Contra-Logic

Challenge the underlying assumptions that make current business work.

### The Process
1. List underlying assumptions that define your industry/function
2. For each, develop an alternate reality (use opposites or insert "not")
3. Generate ideas assuming alternate reality is true

### Example
**Assumption**: High-end restaurant needs high-end retail location

**Flip**: You can serve delicious food anywhere

**Idea**: Gourmet food truck

## Technique #5: Change Perspectives

Adopt the viewpoint of people very different from your team.

### The Process
1. State objective and design criteria
2. Select 5+ perspectives:
   - Middle school teacher
   - Bill Gates
   - A superhero
   - Your primary competitor
   - Oprah
   - Used car salesman
3. Generate ideas from each perspective (10+ per perspective)
4. Adapt relevant ideas to your context

### Why It Works
Diversity of thought is valuable, but teams often share similar expertise. This technique brings virtual team members without scheduling hassles.

## Visual: Analogies Bull's Eye Template

**Page:** 65
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** MEDIUM

### Key Elements
- Center: User context and key attributes
- Rings: Mild (similar) to Wild (very different)
- Space for placing analogy Post-its by distance from center
- Adaptation section for translating insights

## Signs You Need These Tools

- Brainstorming produces same old ideas
- Sessions feel forced or unproductive
- Some team members dominate
- Need more creative stretch
- Want structured approach to ideation

## Tips for All Techniques

- **Use multiple techniques** — at least two per session
- **Document everything** — one idea per Post-it
- **Don't evaluate** — save judgment for later
- **Build on ideas** — "yes, and..." not "but..."
- **Have fun** — playfulness enables creativity

## Common Mistakes

### Only One Technique
Different techniques yield different types of ideas.

### Evaluating During Generation
Criticism kills creativity. Separate generation from evaluation.

### Skipping the Wild Ideas
They often lead to the best insights.

### Not Enough Time
Rush produces predictable ideas. Allow time for multiple rounds.

## Output

- Large quantity of diverse ideas (80+ is achievable)
- Ideas documented on Post-its or cards
- Material from multiple brainstorming approaches
- Ready for Step 9: Develop Concepts
