# Bring-Build-Buy Map

Forming concepts requires linking the demand chain (user insights) with a supply chain capable of meeting that demand. The Bring-Build-Buy map helps you see possibilities for delivering concepts.

## Core Concept

Think of this as a make-buy template with unmet needs as the North Star. It helps you see how different capabilities could come together to deliver a concept.

## The Three Categories

### BRING
Assets and capabilities you have today — your right to win.
- Existing products or services
- Current relationships
- Established channels
- Proven capabilities

### BUILD
New internal capabilities you will create.
- New skills or processes
- Technology development
- New organizational capabilities
- Learning required

### BUY
Key elements you will access through partners or suppliers.
- Partner capabilities
- Outsourced services
- Licensed technology
- Supplier relationships

## Visual: Bring-Build-Buy Template

**Page:** 71
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** MEDIUM

### Visual Description
A diagram showing three boxes (Bring, Build, Buy) feeding into an Offering circle, with a Supply Chain axis running from "Make" to "Buy" across the bottom.

### Key Elements
- Three labeled boxes for Bring/Build/Buy
- Central "Offering" target
- Space for 8-10 Post-its per category
- Supply chain spectrum indicator

## How to Use This Tool

1. **Set up poster or whiteboard** with template
2. **Complete BRING first** — what existing assets/capabilities apply?
3. **Then BUILD** — what new capabilities must you create?
4. **Finally BUY** — what will you get through partners?
5. **Review for gaps** — is anything missing?
6. **Consider alternatives** — different Bring-Build-Buy mixes yield different concepts

## Example: Smoking Cessation Service (Pfizer)

| Bring | Build | Buy |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Nicorette | E-commerce capability | Phone-based counseling |
| Global distribution | | Behavioral expertise |
| Brand credibility | | |

These choices affect both the concept and potential business model.

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Have a concept but haven't thought about execution
- Need to identify partnership requirements
- Evaluating feasibility of different concepts
- Want to compare different delivery models
- Connecting concept to business model

## Common Mistakes

### Skipping BRING
Not recognizing existing assets you could leverage.

### Only One Configuration
Different Bring-Build-Buy mixes create different strategic options.

### Ignoring BUILD Investments
Underestimating what new capabilities are needed.

### Vague BUY Partners
Be specific about what capability you need, even if you don't know the specific partner yet.

## Connection to Other Tools

- Feeds into **Napkin Pitches** (Execution section)
- Builds on **Value Chain Analysis**
- Can set stage for **Forced Connections** and **Combinatorial Play**

## Output

- Completed Bring-Build-Buy map for each concept
- Understanding of capability requirements
- Partner needs identified
- Multiple delivery configurations to consider
