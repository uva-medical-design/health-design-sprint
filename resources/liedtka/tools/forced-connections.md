# Forced Connections

Serendipity and surprise are powerful drivers of creativity. Forced connections stretches minds to find links in unexpected places by juxtaposing seemingly unrelated brainstorming outputs.

## Core Concept

Take three randomly selected ideas and force yourself to connect them into a coherent concept. The "impossible" combinations often yield the most interesting results.

## The Process

Best used with 4-6 people, starting with Post-its from brainstorming:

### Step 1: Review Ideas
Look at all posted ideas. Individually consider which deserve further focus.

### Step 2: Random Selection
Have 3 people each silently and independently select one idea.

### Step 3: Force Connections
Place the 3 ideas together. Generate 3+ interesting, novel, or "impossible" concepts that connect them.

### Step 4: Repeat
Do steps 2-3 at least four more times (keep at it for ~45 minutes).

### Step 5: Capture Promising Concepts
Transfer the most promising concepts to large notes. Proceed to napkin pitches.

## Visual: Forced Connections Template

**Page:** 73
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** LOW

### Key Elements
- Three idea boxes at top
- Three "Forced Connection Concept" boxes below
- Space for describing how ideas connect

## Example

**Three Random Ideas**:
1. "Gamification with points"
2. "Family involvement"
3. "Text message reminders"

**Forced Connection Concepts**:
- A: Family members earn points by supporting each other's goals via text
- B: Daily family challenge delivered by text with leaderboard
- C: Text-based game where family teams compete for wellness goals

The zanier the initial combination, the better — it forces creative thinking.

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Concepts feel predictable
- Ideas aren't combining in interesting ways
- Need to break habitual thinking patterns
- Want to exercise creative muscles
- Team is stuck on obvious solutions

## Tips for Success

- **Embrace the impossible** — don't reject combinations that seem crazy
- **Work quickly** — don't overthink connections
- **Generate multiple concepts** per combination
- **Keep going** — later combinations often yield best results
- **Have fun** — playfulness enables creativity

## Common Mistakes

### Rejecting "Impossible" Combinations
The point is to force connections that wouldn't happen naturally.

### Over-Thinking
Speed and quantity matter more than perfection.

### Stopping Too Early
45 minutes yields better results than 15 minutes.

### Not Enough Variety
Truly random selection creates better variety than picking related ideas.

## Output

- Multiple novel concept combinations
- Stretched thinking and new possibilities
- Material for napkin pitches
