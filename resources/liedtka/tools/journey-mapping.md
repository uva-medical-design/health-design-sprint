# Journey Mapping

Journey mapping is the representation, in flowchart or graphic format, of the stakeholder's experience as they work to accomplish something important to them. These maps can depict actual or ideal journeys.

## Core Concept

Journey maps are especially valuable during What Is as a method for documenting stakeholders' current reality. If your opportunity involves a process or sequence of activities, journey mapping is a great way to synthesize interviews.

**Recommendation**: Use a journey map for every design thinking project that involves a process or purchase decision.

## The Eight-Step Process

### 1. Select the Stakeholder
Whose experience do you want to understand? Investigate their context and situation through ethnographic interviews and observation.

### 2. Define Start and End Points
Decide where the process begins and ends. Start a little before and extend a little after your product/service might be used.

### 3. Plot Each Step
Using the template, plot each step as a point on the journey. Keep total steps under a dozen. Label responsible party above each step.

### 4. Map Emotional State
For each step, plot the stakeholder's emotional state (high, neutral, low). Connect points with a line.

### 5. Circle High Points
Identify 2-3 emotional highs. Label what made each a high point.

### 6. Circle Low Points
Identify 2-3 emotional lows. Label what made each a low point.

### 7. Draw the Ideal Journey
Using a different color, draw what the best-case emotional journey would look like.

### 8. Reflect
Look at the entire map:
- What patterns do you notice?
- Which steps have the most opportunity for improvement?

## Visual: Journey Map Template

**Page:** 55
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** HIGH

### Visual Description
A horizontal template with columns for 6+ journey steps. Rows include: Responsible Party, Description of Step, Emotional scale (High/Neutral/Low) for plotting emotional journey, and Notes & References.

### Key Elements
- Multiple step columns
- Responsible party row at top
- Step description row
- Emotional scale with graphing area
- Notes row at bottom
- Space for both actual and ideal journey lines

### Semantic Tags for This Visual
retrieval_triggers:
  - "journey map template"
  - "customer experience template"
  - "how to create a journey map"

situations:
  - Mapping a user's current experience
  - Visualizing emotional highs and lows
  - Identifying improvement opportunities

### Recreation Notes
HIGH priority for recreation. Core tool used in many sprint phases. Consider interactive digital version that allows adding/removing steps.

## How to Use This Tool

1. **Gather data first** through interviews and observation
2. **Create the map collaboratively** with your team
3. **Focus on one stakeholder type** per map (or create multiple)
4. **Use actual quotes** to annotate emotional points
5. **Look for patterns** across multiple user journeys
6. **Combine with personas** for richer understanding

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Your opportunity involves a process or sequence
- Users describe frustration with current experience
- You need to visualize where problems occur
- Team needs shared understanding of user experience
- Want to identify high-impact improvement areas

## Common Mistakes

### Too Many Steps
Keep it under 12 steps. Consolidate similar activities.

### No Emotional Dimension
The journey line showing emotional highs/lows is key. Don't skip it.

### Only Your Perspective
Map the user's journey, not your internal process.

### Abstract Descriptions
Use specific, concrete step descriptions from user research.

### One-Size-Fits-All
Different personas may have different journeys. Consider multiple maps.

## Using Journey Maps

### Find Pain Points
Emotional lows represent opportunities for improvement.

### Identify Bright Spots
Emotional highs show what's working — can you extend these?

### Compare Actual vs. Ideal
The gap between lines shows where to focus.

### Guide Concept Development
Pain points become design criteria and opportunity areas.

## Output

- Visual journey map(s)
- Documented emotional highs and lows
- Identified pain points and opportunities
- Foundation for insights and design criteria
