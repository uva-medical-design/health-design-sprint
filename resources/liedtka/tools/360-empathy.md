# 360 Empathy

The sensing of unmet needs — especially unarticulated needs — requires deep empathy with users. 360 Empathy is a simple method to forge emotional connection by entering through the user's senses.

## Core Concept

Brainstorming can generate a hundred ideas. But which few are worth exploring? The ones most responsive to unmet needs. This tool helps you connect with the user's emotional world to identify those needs.

## The Six-Step Process

Work through the template in order (outside in):

### Step 1: SEEING
Note what enters through the user's eyes. What is the user literally seeing in relation to the challenge?

### Step 2: HEARING
What experiences occur as sounds? Include words heard and ambient sounds integral to the experience.

### Step 3: DOING
Note key physical movements and behaviors that accompany the challenge. Direct observation data is most insightful here.

### Step 4: SAYING
Summarize the most revealing verbatim words and phrases the user uses when speaking about the challenge.

### Step 5: FEELING (Guesses)
Make guesses about what you believe the user may be feeling. Don't worry if guesses contradict each other — look for breadth of possibilities.

**Resource**: See the CNVC List of Universal Human Feelings

### Step 6: LATENT NEED (Guesses)
Create a short list of possible unmet needs. Use Step 5 results to fuel discussion. The goal is not consensus but intriguing possibilities for brainstorming.

## Visual: 360 Empathy Template

**Page:** 59
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** HIGH

### Visual Description
A template centered around a user figure with six sections radiating outward: Seeing, Hearing, Doing, Saying, Feeling, Latent Need. The first four are factual; the last two are guesses.

### Key Elements
- Area of opportunity header (20 words or less)
- Six labeled sections
- Clear distinction between factual (1-4) and guesses (5-6)
- Adequate space for notes in each section

### Semantic Tags for This Visual
retrieval_triggers:
  - "empathy map template"
  - "360 empathy worksheet"
  - "understanding user feelings template"

situations:
  - Processing interview data empathetically
  - Building emotional understanding of users

### Recreation Notes
HIGH priority. Key tool for building empathy before ideation. Consider visual design that shows the "outside in" progression.

## Key Distinction

| Steps 1-4 | Steps 5-6 |
|-----------|-----------|
| Factual observations | Conjecture and guesses |
| What we observed/heard | What we hypothesize |
| No judgment | Apply judgment |
| Can be validated | May be contradictory |

It's OK — even valuable — for Step 5 and 6 entries to contradict each other. You're exploring possibilities.

## How to Use This Tool

1. **Complete after interviews/observation** — you need data
2. **Write area of opportunity** (20 words or less) at top
3. **Work through steps 1-4** with factual data
4. **Brainstorm steps 5-6** allowing contradictions
5. **Use findings to fuel brainstorming** and identify design criteria

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Have interview data but haven't processed it emotionally
- Team discusses users functionally but not emotionally
- Brainstorming produces functional but not emotionally resonant ideas
- Want to identify unarticulated needs
- Need to take persona understanding deeper

## Common Mistakes

### Skipping to Feelings/Needs
Work outside in. Factual data first, then conjecture.

### Requiring Consensus on Guesses
Contradictory guesses are fine — they're possibilities to explore.

### Using Abstract Language
Specific, sensory details are more powerful than abstractions.

### Not Using the Output
The latent needs identified should directly inform design criteria and brainstorming.

## Universal Human Feelings (Examples)

**When needs are satisfied**: Confident, Excited, Peaceful, Engaged, Hopeful, Grateful, Joyful

**When needs are NOT satisfied**: Afraid, Angry, Confused, Disconnected, Sad, Tense, Vulnerable

## Universal Human Needs (Examples)

**Connection**: Belonging, Acceptance, Appreciation, Empathy, Trust

**Autonomy**: Choice, Freedom, Independence

**Meaning**: Purpose, Contribution, Creativity, Growth, Learning

**Physical Well-being**: Safety, Comfort, Rest

**Peace**: Ease, Harmony, Order

## Output

- Completed 360 empathy map
- Documented sensory experience of user
- Hypothesized feelings
- List of potential latent needs
- Foundation for emotionally resonant ideation
