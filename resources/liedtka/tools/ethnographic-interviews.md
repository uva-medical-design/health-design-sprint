# Ethnographic Interviews

Ethnography is the study of human cultures. For innovation teams, this means studying users in ways that capture the full context of their experience, including behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and cultural meaning.

## Core Concept

The goal is to identify unmet, unarticulated needs that will help you create compelling solutions. This is not like any other interview you've done — you're going beneath the surface.

## The Six-Step Process

### 1. Select People to Interview
- Identify specific individuals based on relationship to your challenge
- Or pick people sharing primary characteristics of your stakeholders
- Include both current users and non-users

### 2. Develop an Interview Guide
- Keep questions open-ended and exploratory
- "Tell me about a time when..." is particularly useful
- Don't lead the witness with your assumptions

### 3. Schedule Interviews
Ethnographic techniques require time:
- Plan 60-120 minutes per interview
- Allow time to establish rapport
- Choose comfortable settings

### 4. Conduct Interviews
- Record (with permission) or capture detailed notes
- Get verbatim comments as much as possible
- Try to interview in pairs (interviewer + note-taker)

### 5. Be Curious About Everything
- Encourage elaboration
- Look for signs of emotion
- Follow unexpected threads

### 6. Capture Findings
- Create 1-2 page summaries per interview
- Include actual quotes
- Highlight reality and unmet needs

## Interview Tips

### Orient, But Don't Prime
Tell users the general nature of your interest. Assure privacy. Don't hint at what you hope to find.

### Ask Short, Factual Questions
Avoid priming. Maximize productivity.
- "When do you shop? How often? Whom do you go with?"
- "Do you have a plan? Do you bring a list?"

### Get Specific Examples
Move quickly past general statements.
- "Show me something you bought recently. Tell me how you bought it."

### Walk Backward, Then Forward
Users start with action. Uncover pre-action and reaction.
- "When did you first decide you needed that?"
- "When you see that in your closet now, what do you think?"

### Ask Attitudinal Questions Last
If you ask what people think/feel early, it colors all responses.

### Document Artifacts and Tools
- Lists, smartphones, websites they use
- Shopping bags, tools, physical objects
- Everything that's part of their process

### Listen for Attitudes, Values, Beliefs
Keywords that signal emotional states:
- Absolutes: "always," "never"
- Judging phrases: "deserved," "should have"
- External authority: "I was stuck having to..."
- Preferences: "I always prefer to..."

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Need to uncover hidden motivations
- Want to build deep empathy
- Looking for unarticulated needs
- Preparing for persona development

## Common Mistakes

### Asking Leading Questions
"Don't you think X would be helpful?" leads the witness.

### Talking Too Much
Your job is to listen. Let them do 80% of the talking.

### Rushing to Solutions
Don't suggest solutions or evaluate their ideas.

### Only Surface-Level Questions
Push beyond initial answers with follow-ups.

### Not Capturing Verbatim Quotes
Exact words matter. Paraphrasing loses nuance.

### Stopping at Opinions
"What do you think?" is weaker than "Tell me about a time when..."

## Output

- Interview summaries (1-2 pages each)
- Verbatim quotes that reveal attitudes and needs
- Artifacts and tools documented
- Foundation for personas, journey maps, and insights
