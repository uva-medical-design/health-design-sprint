# Storytelling

Stories are an innovator's best friend. They bring collaborators the way nectar brings bees to a flower — a time-efficient, memorable way to answer both "What" and "So What?"

## Core Concept

The human brain receives facts and data, but it **participates** in stories by:
- Visualizing details
- Rooting for the protagonist
- Investing in the outcome

These elements help collaborators suspend skepticism and discover what might be possible.

## Story Elements

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Hero** | A customer the listener will care about |
| **Supporting Characters** | Others in the story |
| **Antagonist** | Forces working against the hero |
| **Unexpected Ally** | Your solution! |
| **Setting** | Context where action takes place |
| **Plot Exposition** | Movement toward the goal |
| **Tension** | Conflict between goal and reality ("rising action") |
| **Climax** | Moment of transformation when solution opens unexpected path |
| **Resolution** | What we make of things after the dust settles |

## The Story Template

Build your story following this outline:

---

**Meet** [hero/user]

**She is a** [role] **with a penchant for** [personal attribute]

**who wants to** [goal]

**One day she is at** [setting]

**and she tries to** [move toward goal]

**Instead of** [intended outcome]

**she discovers** [obstacle]

**Now she must** [complication]

**Just when she feels** [authentic emotion]

**she is surprised to discover** [unexpected ally — your solution]

**Suddenly** [path to goal]

**Today she is able to** [simple path to goal]

**and she can realize** [higher-level goal or need]

## Example Story Sketch

*Meet Sarah.*

*She's a busy project manager with a penchant for efficiency who wants to get healthier.*

*One day at work, she realizes she's exhausted by 2pm every day.*

*She tries to eat better and exercise, but instead of feeling better, she discovers she can't stick to any routine.*

*Now she must choose between her demanding job and her health goals.*

*Just when she feels frustrated and hopeless, she's surprised to discover a wellness buddy at work who faces the same challenges.*

*Suddenly, they start checking in on each other, celebrating small wins together.*

*Today she's able to build healthy habits into her existing routine, and she can realize her deeper need for balance and energy in life.*

## Good Stories Are...

- **Brief** — Not more than 1-2 pages
- **Focused on the hero** — The user, not you
- **Rich with imagery** — Sensory details
- **Emotional** — Connect to feelings and needs

## Good Stories Are NOT...

- Value propositions
- Personas (though they can be based on personas)
- Elevator pitches
- Technical specifications

## Forms Stories Can Take

1. Short prose narrative
2. Series of images you speak to
3. Storyboard
4. Video

All rely on imagery to invite listener participation.

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Concept description is dry or technical
- Stakeholders don't connect emotionally with the idea
- Need to communicate quickly and memorably
- Preparing prototype for co-creation
- Want to humanize your concept

## Common Mistakes

### No Hero
Leading with the solution instead of the person.

### No Conflict
Without tension, there's no story. Show the obstacle.

### Too Long
Stories should be brief. Edit ruthlessly.

### Solution as Focus
The hero and their journey are the focus. Your solution is the "unexpected ally."

### All Logic, No Emotion
Stories work through emotion. Include authentic feelings.

## Output

- User-centered narrative
- Compelling communication of concept
- Foundation for storyboards
- Material for co-creation sessions
