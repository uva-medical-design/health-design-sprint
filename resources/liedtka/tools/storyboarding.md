# Storyboarding

A visual story (storyboard) makes concepts even more tangible. Storyboards are useful prototypes anytime a concept will change a significant part of the stakeholder's journey.

## Core Concept

Storyboards look like a cartoon strip — a series of 6-10 glimpses into the stakeholder's journey or concept in action. They're particularly handy for intangible things like processes or systems.

### Why Storyboards Work
- Tell the concept through story
- Put the user in the picture
- Serve as launching pad for co-creation
- Communicate efficiently
- Invite modification and feedback

## Creating a Storyboard

### You Don't Need Drawing Skills
You only need courage to create a few sketches. If paralyzed, use the basic visual elements from the Templates section. Make photocopies and cut out figures to get started.

### The Structure
- **6-10 panels** showing key moments
- **Chronological sequence** of the experience
- **Focus on user** — they're the main character
- **Show, don't just tell** — images over words

### What Each Panel Contains
- A simple sketch or image
- Brief caption or dialogue
- The user and relevant context
- Emotion expressed through faces/body language

## Building Your Storyboard

### Option 1: Draw from Scratch
Use stick figures and simple shapes. Rough is better — it invites feedback.

### Option 2: Cut and Paste
Use template elements, photos, or magazine cutouts. Embellish with your own details.

### Option 3: Digital Tools
Simple slide software or storyboarding apps can work. Keep it rough looking.

## Storyboard for Co-Creation

When using storyboards for co-creation:

1. **Present to stakeholder** one-on-one
2. **Walk through panels** telling the story
3. **Invite reactions** at each step
4. **Provide markers and Post-its** for them to modify
5. **Photograph changes** before resetting
6. **Reset for next session**

### Discussion Guide
Write questions for each panel to elicit feedback:
- "What do you think she's feeling here?"
- "What would you do at this point?"
- "What's missing from this scene?"

## Visual: Storyboard Template

**Page:** 95
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** HIGH

### Visual Description
A template with 6 empty panels arranged in sequence, with space above each for captions or dialogue.

### Key Elements
- 6 sequential panels
- Caption/dialogue space
- Room for notes below
- Clear panel numbering

### Semantic Tags for This Visual
retrieval_triggers:
  - "storyboard template"
  - "how to lay out a storyboard"
  - "storyboard format"

situations:
  - Creating visual prototype of concept
  - Preparing for co-creation session

### Recreation Notes
HIGH priority. Frequently used in co-creation. Consider fillable digital version.

## Sample Storyboard Scenes

The book includes sample "scenes" you can use:
- People in various settings
- Speech and thought bubbles
- Simple objects and environments
- Emotional expressions

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Concept is a process or experience
- Need prototype for co-creation
- Verbal descriptions aren't landing
- Want users to modify and react
- Can't (or shouldn't) build functional prototype yet

## Common Mistakes

### Too Many Panels
Keep it to 6-10. Tell the essential story only.

### All Words, No Images
The visual is the point. Minimize text.

### No User Visible
The stakeholder must be in the panels.

### Too Polished
Rough invites feedback. Polished signals "finished."

### Single Version
Create alternative storyboards for different concepts or approaches.

## Tips for Non-Artists

- **Trace or copy** — it's not cheating
- **Use photo collage** — cut and paste images
- **Stick figures work** — really
- **Add speech bubbles** — let characters talk
- **Label if needed** — words help clarify

## Output

- 6-10 panel storyboard showing concept in action
- Prototype ready for co-creation sessions
- Visual communication of user experience
- Foundation for collecting stakeholder feedback
