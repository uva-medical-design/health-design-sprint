# Direct Observation

Innovative solutions depend upon fresh insights, and direct observation often yields the crucial clues. Step into the user's "native habitat" and capture the full context, without interpretation or judgment.

## Core Concept

There's often a discrepancy between what people say and what people do. Through direct observation, you uncover unexpected attitudes, behaviors, and embedded meanings that fuel truly innovative solutions.

### The Scientist Mindset
Imagine you're part of a team of scientists and you alone have been selected to go to the field. Your colleagues are waiting for you to return with every clue possible.

## Sample Size

Typically 8-20 subjects in total, but you'll make scores of observations about each one. The goal is **not statistical certainty** but the cultivation of new hypotheses to explore later.

## Tips to Guide Your Research

### Set the Scene
- Record time, date, and place
- Note any particular events occurring
- Document who is present in the environment

### Observe the People
- Age, appearance, attire
- Names if you know them
- Distinguishing characteristics

### Observe Physical Space
- Room setup and artifacts
- Smell, temperature, lighting
- Sound levels and ambient noise

### Observe Group Interactions
- Are people standing in groups?
- What's their attitude toward one another?
- Who speaks first?

### Observe Non-Verbal Behaviors
- Laughing, smiling, body language
- Facial expressions
- Eye contact, crossed arms

### Record with Hands and Tools
- Written notes in real time
- Camera or video (with permission)
- Document artifacts and details

### Zero in on the Unexpected
- Note observations that jump out
- Use margins for surprising findings
- Trust your intuition about what's interesting

### Just the Facts
- **Observation**: "The two women are facing each other and laughing"
- **Interpretation** (avoid!): "The two women are friends" or "One said something funny"

## How to Use This Tool

1. **Identify where to observe** users in their natural context
2. **Get access** through relationships or public spaces
3. **Prepare observation guides** with categories to watch for
4. **Observe without interacting** (as much as possible)
5. **Document factually** without interpretation
6. **Capture with multiple media** — notes, photos, video
7. **Note the unexpected** in margins or separately

## Signs You Need This Tool

- You only know what users say, not what they do
- Research is all interviews, no observation
- You suspect stated behaviors differ from actual behaviors
- Need fresh insights beyond what people report
- Starting to understand a new context

## Common Mistakes

### Interpreting While Observing
Separate data collection from analysis. Just record facts.

### Too Little Time
Brief observations miss patterns. Plan adequate time.

### Influencing Behavior
Your presence changes behavior. Be as unobtrusive as possible.

### Not Recording Details
Memories fade. Capture everything in real time.

### Relying Only on Observation
Combine with interviews to understand why behaviors occur.

## Output

Detailed observation notes that provide:
- Factual behavioral data
- Environmental context
- Unexpected discoveries
- Questions to explore in interviews
