# Secondary Research

Just because you're using design thinking and incorporating ethnography doesn't mean you should ignore quantitative or qualitative data you already have.

## Core Concept

Past research reports, user surveys, performance data, and financial reports can all be important additions to your What Is gallery. This information contributes to a richer picture of current reality and may reassure colleagues skeptical about design thinking.

## What to Gather

### Internal Data You May Have
- Past research reports
- User surveys
- Performance data
- Financial reports
- Customer feedback
- Previous project learnings

### External Sources to Explore
- Research reports summarizing industry trends
- Press releases from competitors
- Articles in association magazines
- Academic research
- News coverage
- Analyst reports

## Key Questions to Answer

### Question 1: What Do I Already Know?
What do I already know about my business and customers/users that might matter to my project?

### Question 2: What's Happening in the Environment?
What are some of the trends and uncertainties in the larger environment surrounding my project?

| Area | Relevant Trends | Big Uncertainties |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Industry | | |
| Target Customer | | |
| Technology | | |
| Society | | |

## How to Use This Tool

1. **Gather existing data** from internal and external sources
2. **Review for relevance** to your specific project
3. **Identify trends** that might impact your opportunity
4. **Note uncertainties** that could affect outcomes
5. **Add to your What Is gallery** as posters or summaries
6. **Use to inform interview questions** for primary research

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Starting a new project and need context
- Haven't reviewed what's already known
- Need to identify major trends
- Team members disagree about basic facts
- Want to impress skeptical stakeholders

## Common Mistakes

### Skipping It Entirely
Thinking primary research will reveal everything. You'll waste time rediscovering known information.

### Over-Relying on It
Secondary research tells you what's known, not what's hidden. It can't replace talking to users.

### Not Questioning Sources
Data can be biased or outdated. Consider the source and recency.

### Analysis Paralysis
Don't spend months researching. Get enough context to inform primary research, then move on.

## Tips for Success

- **Fire up your search engine** and explore broadly
- **Talk to industry experts** and thought leaders
- **Check association resources** in your field
- **Review competitor activities** and announcements
- **Look for contradictions** — where do sources disagree?
- **Document sources** for later reference
