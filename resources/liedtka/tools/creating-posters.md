# Creating Posters

Once you've gathered data, the next challenge is sharing it. Instead of PowerPoint, use posters — large visual displays that create focal points for conversation and a shared perspective.

## Core Concept

Posters (24x36 inches or larger) create visual focal points for conversations. Unlike slides that disappear with a click, posters stay visible so teams can refer to them throughout their work.

## The Four-Step Process

### 1. Review and List
Review data collected and list information to share:
- Individual interviews
- Secondary research results
- Journey maps, personas, other tool outputs

### 2. Curate to 25-30 Posters
Like a museum curator, select poster topics that create interesting conversations. More isn't necessarily better.

### 3. Prepare Close to the Source
- Use direct quotations from interviews
- Display quantitative data without added interpretation
- Don't let assumptions obstruct the data
- Goal: Invite everyone to help find insights

### 4. Produce the Posters
**Option A**: Create in software, enlarge at copy shop (~$5 per black-and-white poster)

**Option B**: Write on flip-chart pages (write neatly!)

## Interview Summary Poster Template

**Page:** 61
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** MEDIUM

### Key Elements
- First name
- Age and occupation
- Relationship to challenge
- Descriptive information (magazines, attire, typical day)
- Quotes showcasing attitude, behavior, and needs

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Have completed research and need to share findings
- Team is about to synthesize insights
- Need alternatives to slide presentations
- Want to create a "war room" for the project
- Preparing for mind mapping session

## Tips for Effective Posters

### Keep Data Raw
Let people draw their own conclusions. Avoid interpretation.

### Use Quotes Liberally
Direct words from users are more powerful than summaries.

### Make Them Large
Big enough for a group to view simultaneously.

### Display Prominently
Put them on walls where the team can see and reference them.

### Include Visual Data
Journey maps, personas, and charts make great posters.

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Interpreting
Present data, not conclusions. Let the team find insights together.

### Too Many Posters
Curate thoughtfully. 25-30 is plenty.

### Poor Legibility
If people can't read it easily, it won't get used.

### Storing Instead of Displaying
Posters need to be visible, not filed away.

## Output

- 25-30 posters displaying research findings
- Visual gallery ready for team analysis
- Foundation for insight identification session
