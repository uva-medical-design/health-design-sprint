# Personas

Personas are archetypes — fictional characters we create that typify different types of stakeholders. They're based on real research but represent a synthesis of characteristics.

## Core Concept

We use personas to bring stakeholders to life — not as demographic descriptions or people to be sold to, but as flesh-and-blood people with names, challenges, hopes, and dreams. Then we design specific solutions for each attractive persona.

## The Three-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify Dimensions
Study themes from your research to identify dimensions that reveal differences within your stakeholder group.

**Key Insight**: Use psychographic rather than demographic dimensions. What beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors distinguish different users?

**Resource**: The list of universal human needs (CNVC) is useful for generating dimensions.

### Step 2: Create a 2x2 Matrix
- Select revealing dimensions
- Pair two dimensions to create a 2x2 matrix
- Map each interviewee into the quadrant that fits best
- Try variations until you find dimensions that distribute interviewees across at least 3 of 4 quadrants

**Example dimensions**:
- "Social behavior": Introverted ↔ Extroverted
- "Spending habits": Frugal ↔ Free-spending

### Step 3: Create Persona Characters
For each populated quadrant, create a persona:
- Give them a name
- Describe demographics and psychographics
- Focus on what makes this archetype unique

## Visual: Persona 2x2 Matrix

**Page:** 57
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** HIGH

### Visual Description
A 2x2 grid with dimension labels on axes. Each quadrant contains space for a persona description with name and characteristics.

### Key Elements
- Two axes with dimension labels
- Four quadrants for personas
- Space for persona names and descriptions
- Interview subjects plotted as reference points

### Semantic Tags for This Visual
retrieval_triggers:
  - "persona matrix template"
  - "2x2 persona grid"
  - "how to organize personas"

situations:
  - Creating user archetypes from research
  - Identifying meaningful user segments

### Recreation Notes
HIGH priority. Core synthesis tool. Consider interactive version for plotting interviewees.

## Combining with Journey Mapping

Map the journey of each persona. Each will reveal its own set of low points — "pain points" that represent valuable innovation opportunities for that customer type.

- Some pain points may be shared across personas (particularly fruitful targets)
- Generate ideas designed specifically for each persona

## How to Use This Tool

1. **Complete interviews first** — you need real data
2. **Brainstorm potential dimensions** from research themes
3. **Experiment with combinations** until distribution works
4. **Create rich persona descriptions** for each quadrant
5. **Give them names** — personalization increases empathy
6. **Use throughout the project** — reference personas in ideation

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Research shows users aren't all the same
- Team talks about "users" as monolithic group
- Need to prioritize which users to design for
- Want to humanize research findings
- Preparing for targeted ideation

## Common Mistakes

### Demographic Dimensions Only
"Age" and "income" rarely reveal meaningful differences. Use psychographic dimensions.

### Too Many Personas
4 is usually enough. More becomes unwieldy.

### Not Based on Research
Personas must come from actual interviews, not assumptions.

### Too Abstract
Include enough detail that team can empathize with the persona as a real person.

### Not Using Them
Creating personas then ignoring them wastes the effort. Reference them constantly.

## Example Persona Elements

**Name**: "Skeptical Sarah"

**Demographics**: 42, project manager, two kids

**Psychographics**: Values proof over promises, researches extensively before decisions, skeptical of fads, seeks recommendations from trusted sources

**Behaviors**: Reads reviews, asks friends, delays decisions until confident

**Needs**: Evidence that something works, low-risk way to try, peer validation

**Pain Points**: Hype without substance, pressure to decide quickly, lack of credible information

## Output

- 2x2 matrix with dimension labels
- 3-4 persona descriptions with names
- Rich characterization based on research
- Foundation for targeted solution design
