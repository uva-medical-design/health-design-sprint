# Co-Creation Tools

Any time a potential user helps modify or enhance your concept, that's co-creation. Co-creation always relies on stimulus — some representation they can interact with physically or imaginatively.

## Core Concept

It's hard to partner with users without sliding into "sell" mode. These tools keep conversations grounded in exploration and iteration — and make them more fun.

## Tool #1: Linear Storyboard (Narrated)

The storyboard efficiently communicates experience while leaving white space for interpretation.

### How It Works
- Present a fixed-route storyboard (like a train)
- Present an alternative route alongside it
- Side-by-side approach invites mixing and matching

### User Interaction Methods
- **Green/red dots**: Mark appealing vs. annoying aspects
- **Post-it notes**: Add comments and questions to panels
- **Standing engagement**: Body language is more pronounced when standing

**Key Insight**: Having users physically interact shifts mindset from "validation" to "participation."

## Tool #2: Build-Your-Own Storyboard

A less prescriptive version where users configure the experience themselves.

### How It Works
- Spread panels on a table showing different features
- Let users "shop" for appealing elements
- Include blank panels for them to invent missing elements
- Watch what they choose and what they create

## Tool #3: Cartoon with Blank Speech Bubbles

Let users express emotional needs by populating storyboards with blank speech or thought bubbles.

### How It Works
- Create panels with characters
- Leave speech/thought bubbles empty
- Users write the dialogue and build their own narrative

**Key Insight**: Often the most subdued customers surprise you with expressiveness in this format.

## Tool #4: Card Sort

Let users consider up to two dozen features and judge relative value.

### How It Works
1. Print feature names on index cards (e.g., "Live phone coach 24/7")
2. Ask users to sort into categories:
   - Must-Have
   - Nice-to-Have
   - Indifferent/Omit
3. Other choice frames work too
4. Value is in what's said about choices, not just the sorting

## Tool #5: Video Prototype

Create a short video showing someone using the new service.

### How It Works
1. Make simple video of concept in action
2. Show to target customers
3. Ask about appealing parts and unrealistic/unwanted parts
4. Give them control of pause button
5. Record their comments

## Tool #6: 3D Mock-up

For many solutions, mock up the experience and have users act out their role.

### Example
For a new hospitality lobby experience, build a mock-up at one property and let people try it out. Users are surprisingly adept at make-believe.

## Important Reminder

Co-creation is your opportunity to let users show you what's most important to them.

**It is NOT**:
- Time to show how well you listened
- A place to "sell" your prototypes
- A validation exercise

The user should do 80% of the talking.

## Signs You Need These Tools

- Have prototypes ready for user feedback
- Want structured methods for co-creation
- Previous feedback sessions felt like "selling"
- Need to avoid confirmation bias
- Want users actively shaping the solution

## Choosing the Right Tool

| Situation | Tool |
|-----------|------|
| Process or journey concept | Linear or build-your-own storyboard |
| Emotional needs unclear | Blank speech bubble cartoon |
| Many features to prioritize | Card sort |
| Service or experience concept | Video prototype |
| Physical environment concept | 3D mock-up |

## Common Mistakes

### Selling Mode
If you're talking more than listening, you're doing it wrong.

### Single Concept
Without choices, users can't show preferences. Provide alternatives.

### Group Sessions
Individual sessions yield more honest feedback.

### Over-Explaining
Let users react before you explain intentions.

### Not Capturing Changes
Document every modification users make.

## Output

- User-modified prototypes
- Documented preferences and reactions
- Insights for concept iteration
- Validated or invalidated assumptions
