# Combinatorial Play

A systematic way of mixing and matching "ingredients" of ideas. A handful of individual ideas can transform into a mountain of possible concepts. This ensures you don't overlook any solution.

## Core Concept

Remember algebra class — combinations and permutations? When you mix-and-match, a few ideas become many possible concepts. Some may be wacky, but you won't miss anything.

### The Chili Analogy
Think of brainstormed ideas as ingredients for chili. Group them by category (meat, beans, veggies, spices), then create recipes by combining different ingredients.

## The Process

### Step 1: Gather Ideas
Collect all brainstormed ideas.

### Step 2: Clean Up
- Eliminate redundancies
- Identify gaps
- Add ideas where needed

### Step 3: Group by Category
Group similar ideas like chili ingredients:
- What are your "ingredient categories"?
- List ideas from each group in columns

### Step 4: Build "Recipes"
Create concepts by combining elements from different columns:
- **Vegetarian chili**: Lots of veggies, no meat
- **Meat lover's**: Every kind of meat, no veggies
- **Hawaiian**: Ham and pineapple, no spice

### Step 5: Go Crazy
After obvious combinations, play with "crazy" ones:
- Randomly select from each category
- What new variations emerge?

## Visual: Chili Table Template

**Page:** 75
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** MEDIUM

### Visual Description
A table with columns for different idea categories and rows for individual ideas within each category. Space at bottom for recording concept "recipes."

### Key Elements
- Column headers for categories
- Rows for ideas within each category
- Recipe section below for documenting combinations
- Space for multiple concepts

## Example Categories

For a wellness program:
| Engagement | Support | Incentives | Technology |
|------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Challenges | Coaching | Points | Mobile app |
| Social | Peer buddies | Prizes | Wearables |
| Individual | Expert Q&A | Recognition | Portal |
| Team | Family | Discounts | Text |

**Recipe 1**: Team + Peer buddies + Recognition + Mobile app
**Recipe 2**: Individual + Coaching + Points + Text
**Recipe 3** (wild): Social + Family + Discounts + Wearables

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Want comprehensive exploration of possibilities
- Worried about missing good combinations
- Have clearly distinct idea categories
- Need structure for concept generation
- Want both obvious and surprising concepts

## Tips for Success

- **Be thorough** with categories — don't miss a type of ingredient
- **Try the obvious first** — validate common-sense combinations
- **Then go random** — surprising combinations spark creativity
- **Don't filter too early** — capture all concepts, evaluate later
- **Work as a team** — multiple perspectives find more recipes

## Common Mistakes

### Too Few Categories
More categories mean more combinations and possibilities.

### Only Obvious Recipes
Random combinations often yield the most interesting concepts.

### Filtering While Generating
Capture everything first, evaluate later.

### Poor Category Definition
Categories should be distinct types, not overlapping.

## Output

- Comprehensive set of concept combinations
- Both conventional and surprising "recipes"
- Confidence that possibilities weren't missed
- Material for napkin pitches
