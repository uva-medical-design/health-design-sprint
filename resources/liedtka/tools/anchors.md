# Anchors

After brainstorming is when teams often get stuck. Choosing good concept anchors is the way out.

## Core Concept

Many high-potential concepts never see the light of day, ending up in conference room trash cans. Anchors provide gravitational pull to bring elements of a concept into a coherent whole while keeping concepts genuinely distinct.

### The Two Failure Modes
1. Can't decide what to do next
2. Decide to do only one thing (picking a winner too early)

### The Solution
Strong alternatives come from choosing anchors to form distinctive concepts, each shown to customers as visual prototypes.

## Tips for Choosing Anchors

### Themes — Unique vs. Shared
1. Identify 8-10 themes from brainstorming (analytics, social media, self-service, mobile, risk-sharing, etc.)
2. Choose 3-4 themes to be **unique** (used in only one concept)
3. Allow other themes to be **shared** across concepts
4. Result: Distinct alternative concepts

**Example**: Self-service, risk-sharing, and concierge could be unique anchors for three different concepts.

### Vary the Focal Point
Choose 2-3 different user types as focal points for distinct concepts.

**Example (healthcare)**: Concept A focuses on chronic disease patients; Concept B focuses on prevention-oriented healthy adults.

### End-to-End vs. Targeted
- **End-to-end concept**: Comprehensive experience
- **Targeted concept**: Goes deep on one key aspect

Use these distinctions as anchors to see what customers value most.

### Mechanics vs. Humanics
- **Mechanics-driven**: Technology-centric solution
- **Human-driven**: Relationship and service-centric solution

If both are possible, use them as anchors for different concepts.

### Business Models
Choose non-traditional business models as anchors:
- Subscription-based
- Risk-sharing
- Freemium
- Platform/marketplace

## How to Use This Tool

1. **Review all brainstormed ideas** — look for emerging themes
2. **Identify 8-10 themes** that could anchor concepts
3. **Select 3-4 for unique assignment** — each appears in only one concept
4. **Build concepts around unique anchors** allowing other elements to be shared
5. **Verify distinctiveness** — concepts should offer genuine choices

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Brainstorming generated many ideas but concepts look similar
- Team wants to converge on one idea too quickly
- Need to give stakeholders real choices
- Big themes are emerging but not yet structured

## Common Mistakes

### All Themes Shared
If every element appears in every concept, they're not distinct.

### Picking Winners in the Room
The right person to choose is the customer, not the team.

### Not Enough Variety
Use different types of anchors (themes, focal points, business models).

### Abandoning Wild Ideas
Some of the best anchors come from unexpected themes.

## Example: Three Anchored Concepts

**Theme pool**: Analytics, Social Support, Mobile, Gamification, Self-Service, Expert Coaching

**Concept A — "Self-Directed Journey"**
- **Unique anchor**: Self-Service
- Shared: Mobile, Analytics

**Concept B — "Community Challenge"**
- **Unique anchor**: Social Support + Gamification
- Shared: Mobile

**Concept C — "Expert Guide"**
- **Unique anchor**: Expert Coaching
- Shared: Analytics, Mobile

Each concept is genuinely different, offering users real choice.

## Output

- 3-5 distinct concept anchors
- Clear assignment of unique vs. shared themes
- Foundation for building genuinely different concepts
