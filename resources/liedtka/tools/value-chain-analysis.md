# Value Chain Analysis

Value chain analysis is the study of your interaction with partners to create value and deliver offerings. It's the business-side equivalent of customer journey mapping, highlighting pain points and opportunities in collaboration.

## Core Concept

From value chain analysis emerge important clues about partners' capabilities and intentions, and your own vulnerabilities and opportunities.

## The Seven-Step Process

### 1. Draw the Value Chain
Identify each cluster of activities, working backward from value delivered to customers.

**Typical elements**: Component Supply → Manufacturing → Distribution → Sales → Service → End User

### 2. Analyze Competitive Environment
For each box, identify key players.

### 3. Identify Core Capabilities
What strategic capabilities are needed to produce value in each box? What does each contribute?

### 4. Evaluate Bargaining Power
For each player:
- Who drives performance?
- How easy to find a substitute?
- How much value does the customer perceive from this player?

### 5. Determine Improvement Possibilities
Where can you improve your power and profitability?

### 6. Assess Vulnerabilities
Where are you vulnerable to others changing their footprint?

### 7. Identify Themes
Draw conclusions about bargaining power, capabilities, partners, and defensibility.

## Visual: Value Chain Map Template

**Page:** 53
**Type:** template
**Recreation Priority:** MEDIUM

### Visual Description
A horizontal flow diagram showing value chain stages from component supply through end user, with space to analyze competitive environment, capabilities, and positioning questions.

### Key Elements
- Sequential boxes for activity clusters
- Space for competitive analysis per box
- Questions about capabilities, customer case, and positioning
- Room for multiple players per activity

## Key Questions to Answer

### The Capabilities Question
For each activity cluster: What skills and processes are needed to succeed?

### The Customer Case Question
How does the network create and enhance value as defined by the customer?

### The Business Case Question
What is the potential value capture of different roles?
- Who drives performance?
- Who has customer loyalty?
- Where does strategic intent align and diverge?

### The Positioning Question
- Where are we vulnerable?
- What possibilities exist to shift/strengthen our role?
- What new capabilities do we need?
- Who should our partners be?

## Signs You Need This Tool

- Don't understand how value is created in your industry
- Want to identify partnership opportunities
- Need to assess competitive vulnerabilities
- Looking for business model innovation
- Analyzing where to play in the ecosystem

## Common Mistakes

### Too Granular
Map clusters of activities, not individual tasks.

### Ignoring Power Dynamics
Understanding who has power reveals where opportunities lie.

### Static Analysis
Value chains evolve. Consider how they might shift.

### Only Mapping Your Current Position
Consider where you could play, not just where you are.

## Output

- Visual map of the value chain
- Analysis of competitive dynamics per activity
- Identified opportunities and vulnerabilities
- Strategic themes about positioning
