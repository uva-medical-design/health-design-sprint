## Problem Statement

<!-- One clear sentence: Who has what problem, and why does it matter? -->


## Background & Research

<!-- Key findings from your user research (2-3 paragraphs) -->


## Target Users

<!-- Specific description of who you're designing for -->


## User Needs

<!-- Top 3-5 needs identified from research -->
1.
2.
3.

## How Might We...?

<!-- Your chosen HMW statement that frames the design challenge -->


## Proposed Solution Direction

<!-- What you plan to prototype (not the full solution, just the direction) -->


## Hypothesis

<!-- What do you believe will happen? What are you testing? -->


## Success Metrics

<!-- How will you know if the prototype works? What will you measure? -->


## Scope & Constraints

<!-- What's in scope? What's explicitly out of scope? -->

**In scope:**
-

**Out of scope:**
-

### Feasibility Guardrails

<!-- Faculty will review these criteria during design brief approval -->

| Criterion | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Data Access** | Can we get the data we need without HIPAA/IRB complications? | |
| **User Availability** | Can we reach 4-6 users for interviews and testing within 2 weeks? | |
| **Technical Scope** | Can this be prototyped with Claude Code/Replit in ~3 days? | |
| **Regulatory** | Does this avoid clinical decision-making that requires FDA clearance? | |
| **Time Bound** | Can we complete a testable prototype by Day 8? | |

**Faculty Scoping Notes:**
<!-- Instructor feedback on feasibility -->


## Open Questions

*This brief is a hypothesis. It will evolve based on what you learn from prototyping and testing.*
