# Testing

User testing and iteration (Days 7-9)

## Subfolders

- `protocols/` - Test scripts, questions to ask
- `feedback/` - Raw user feedback, session notes
- `iterations/` - Changes made based on feedback

## Tips

- Write your test protocol before testing
- Observe first, interpret later
- Document exact quotes when possible
- Not all feedback should be acted on—document what you chose to ignore and why
