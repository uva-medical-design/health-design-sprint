# Prototype

Building phase (Days 6-9)

## Subfolders

- `v1/` - First prototype attempt
- `v2/` - Iteration after feedback
- `assets/` - Images, icons, shared resources

## Tips

- Create new version folders for major iterations
- Don't overwrite—you might want to go back
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- "Broken but learning" is progress
