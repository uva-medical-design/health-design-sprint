## Project Summary
<!-- One paragraph describing what you're building and why -->


## Problem Statement
<!-- Who has this problem? What is the problem? Why does it matter? -->


## Target Users
<!-- Be specific: "M4 students during residency interview season" not "medical students" -->


## Current Phase
<!-- Update this as you progress -->
- [ ] Research (Days 1-3)
- [ ] Define & Ideate (Days 3-4)
- [ ] Design Brief (Day 5)
- [ ] Prototype (Days 6-8)
- [ ] Test & Iterate (Days 7-9)
- [ ] Polish & Present (Days 9-10)

## Key Decisions Made
<!-- Document important choices and why you made them -->

## Team Members
<!-- Names and any role divisions -->

## Constraints
<!-- Time limits, technical limits, scope boundaries -->
- 2-week timeline (Feb 16-27)
- No patient data
- Prototype should be testable with classmates


## What Claude Should Know
<!-- Any specific context that helps Claude assist you better -->
- We're M4 medical students
- This is for a design sprint course, not production software
- Feedback and iteration matter more than polish
- We have access to Claude Pro, GitHub, Zoom, Vapi


## Current Blockers
<!-- What are you stuck on? Update this when you need help -->

## How to Use This File

1. **Fill in the sections** as your project develops
2. **Update "Current Phase"** each time you move forward
3. **Document key decisions** so you remember why you made them
4. **List blockers** when you're stuck—then ask Claude for help
5. **Keep it current**—outdated context leads to confused AI

When you start a Claude Code session, this file is automatically read. The more accurate it is, the better Claude can help you.
