# Presentation

Final deliverables (Days 9-10)

## Subfolders

- `slides/` - Presentation slides (Gamma, PowerPoint, etc.)

## Key Files

- `demo-script.md` - Script for your prototype demo
- `final-reflection.md` - Team's learning journey summary

## Final Presentation Format

- 15 minutes presentation + 10 minutes Q&A
- Tell the story of your journey, not just the output
- Demo the prototype (even if imperfect)
- Share what you learned, including failures

## Tips

- Practice the timing
- Know who's presenting which sections
- Have a backup if the demo fails
- Failures are part of the story—own them
