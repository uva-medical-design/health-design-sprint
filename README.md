# Health Design Sprint

A 2-week medical student elective combining design thinking methodology with AI-assisted prototyping to solve real healthcare challenges.

## Course Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 2 weeks |
| **Start Date** | February 16, 2026 |
| **Locations** | UVA Charlottesville, Inova Campus |
| **Team Size** | 4-5 students |
| **Output** | Functional healthcare prototype |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this elective, students will be able to:

- Apply design thinking methodology to healthcare problems
- Conduct effective user research with patients, clinicians, and staff
- Synthesize research into actionable insights and problem statements
- Rapidly prototype solutions using AI-assisted development tools
- Test and iterate based on user feedback
- Present and hand off a functional prototype

## The 14 Phases

### Week 1: Discover & Define

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 1. Problem Exploration | Identify and scope healthcare challenges |
| 2. Stakeholder Mapping | Map all affected parties and their relationships |
| 3. User Research | Conduct interviews and contextual observations |
| 4. Empathy Synthesis | Create personas and journey maps |
| 5. Problem Definition | Craft "How Might We" statements |
| 6. Ideation | Generate diverse solution concepts |
| 7. Concept Selection | Evaluate and select promising directions |

### Week 2: Develop & Deliver

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 8. Rapid Prototyping | Build low-fidelity prototypes |
| 9. User Testing Round 1 | Gather initial feedback |
| 10. Iteration | Refine based on insights |
| 11. AI-Assisted Development | Build functional prototypes |
| 12. User Testing Round 2 | Validate with working prototype |
