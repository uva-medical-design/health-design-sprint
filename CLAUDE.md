# Health Design Sprint - Course Project

## Overview

This is a **2-week medical student elective** teaching design thinking and AI-assisted prototyping. Students learn to identify healthcare problems, empathize with stakeholders, and rapidly build functional prototypes using modern AI tools.

## Course Structure

- **Duration**: 2 weeks (14 phases)
- **Team Size**: 4-5 students per team
- **Locations**: UVA Charlottesville and Inova campuses
- **Start Date**: February 16, 2026

## The 14 Phases

1. **Problem Exploration** - Identify and scope healthcare challenges
2. **Stakeholder Mapping** - Identify all affected parties
3. **User Research** - Conduct interviews and observations
4. **Empathy Synthesis** - Consolidate insights into personas
5. **Problem Definition** - Craft focused problem statements
6. **Ideation** - Generate diverse solution concepts
7. **Concept Selection** - Evaluate and choose promising ideas
8. **Rapid Prototyping** - Build low-fidelity prototypes
9. **User Testing Round 1** - Initial feedback collection
10. **Iteration** - Refine based on feedback
11. **AI-Assisted Development** - Build functional prototypes using AI tools
12. **User Testing Round 2** - Validate functional prototypes
13. **Final Refinement** - Polish and document solutions
14. **Handoff** - Present and transfer deliverables

## Project Structure

```
curriculum/     - Daily schedules, learning objectives, facilitator guides
templates/      - Worksheets, canvases, and frameworks for each phase
examples/       - Sample outputs and past project references
projects/       - Student team project folders
resources/      - Reading materials, tool guides, reference documents
```

## Working with This Project

When assisting with course development:
- Curriculum materials should be practical and time-boxed for the 2-week format
- Templates should be simple enough for rapid use during sessions
- Examples should reflect realistic healthcare contexts
- All materials should support both campus locations

## Key Principles

- **Learn by doing**: Minimize lectures, maximize hands-on activities
- **Fail fast**: Encourage rapid iteration over perfect planning
- **Real problems**: Work on authentic healthcare challenges
- **AI as collaborator**: Use AI tools to accelerate prototyping, not replace thinking
