# Vapi Voice Agent Guide

## What Is This?

During the Health Design Sprint, you'll have brief voice conversations with an AI agent built on Vapi. Think of it as a quick reflection partner—not a replacement for human connection, but a structured moment to pause and think.

**The agent is:**
- A learning tool (reflection helps solidify learning)
- A communication channel (your check-ins inform the daily summary)
- A course demonstration (you're experiencing what you might build)

**The agent is NOT:**
- Surveillance (Matt can't listen live)
- Evaluative (nothing you say affects your grade)
- Mandatory for the morning session (afternoon is required, morning is encouraged)

## Daily Touchpoints

### 1. Morning Reflection (Optional)
**When:** After your solo exercise, before the 10am Zoom
**Duration:** ~90 seconds
**Purpose:** Connect your pre-work to the day ahead

The agent might ask:
- "Good morning! You just finished [today's exercise]. What stood out to you?"
- "Today we're focusing on [day's theme]. What's one thing you're hoping to understand better?"
- "Any questions from the exercise you want to bring to the group?"

**Why do this?**
Starting the day with a voiced reflection primes your thinking. It's like warming up before exercise.

### 2. Afternoon Check-In (Required)
**When:** 3:15 PM (15 minutes before GitHub commit deadline)
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes
**Purpose:** Capture progress, surface blockers, light coaching

The agent might ask:
- "What did you accomplish this afternoon?"
- "Where are you in the current phase of your workflow?"
- "What's one thing you tried that didn't work? What did you learn from it?"
- "Is there anything you're uncertain about?"
- "What's your plan for tomorrow?"

**What happens with this?**
Your responses (along with your GitHub commits and the morning Zoom transcript) feed into the automated daily summary that Matt uses to facilitate the 4pm closeout.

**Can the agent help me?**
Yes! If you mention being stuck on a concept, the agent may suggest relevant resources from the course library.

### 3. Team Log (Required, Rotating)
**When:** End of day, one person per team
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes
**Purpose:** Team coordination and documentation

The agent asks:
- "What did your team complete today?"
- "Any decisions or pivots you made? What prompted them?"
- "What's blocking progress?"
- "How's the team dynamic feeling?"

**Rotation:** Teams decide who does this each day. Everyone should do it at least twice during the course.

## Tips for Good Check-Ins

### Be Honest
The agent doesn't judge. "I'm stuck and frustrated" is more useful than "Everything's fine."

### Be Specific
Instead of: "I worked on my project"
Try: "I drafted three interview questions and scheduled one user interview for tomorrow"

### Think Out Loud
The act of articulating helps you process. Don't worry about sounding polished.

### It's Okay to Be Brief
If you genuinely have nothing to add, a 60-second check-in is fine. The structure is the point, not the length.

## Privacy & Data

**What's recorded:** The conversation is transcribed and stored.

**Who sees it:**
- Matt (for course facilitation)
- Aggregated themes may be shared with the group (anonymized)
- Individual transcripts are not shared with other students

**What it's used for:**
- Daily summary generation
- Identifying students who need support
- Improving the agent for future courses

**What it's NOT used for:**
- Grading
- Evaluation
- Anything outside this course

---

## Giving Feedback on the Agent

Part of the 4pm Zoom closeout includes a quick check:

*"How was the voice check-in today? Helpful? Annoying? Ideas to improve it?"*

Your feedback shapes how the agent evolves during the course. Matt built this specifically for you—help make it better.

## If Something Goes Wrong

**Agent doesn't understand you:**
- Rephrase and try again
- It's okay to say "Let's skip that question"

**Technical issues (can't connect, audio problems):**
- Try the alternate access method (phone vs. web)
- Message Matt or post in the course channel
- Don't stress—the agent is a tool, not a test

**Agent says something weird:**
- AI sometimes hallucinates or misunderstands
- Take what's useful, ignore what's not
- Report strange behavior so it can be fixed

## Why Voice?

You might wonder: why voice instead of a form or text chat?

**Voice forces reflection.** Typing lets you edit and curate. Speaking is more raw, more honest, more in-the-moment.

**Voice is faster.** A 3-minute conversation captures more than a 3-minute survey.

**Voice is a skill.** Articulating your thinking verbally is a professional skill worth practicing.

**Voice is the future.** AI voice interfaces are becoming common. This is a chance to experience one thoughtfully.

*The best check-in is the one you actually do. Don't overthink it.*
