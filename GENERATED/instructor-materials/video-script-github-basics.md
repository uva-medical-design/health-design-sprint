## SEGMENT 1: Why This Matters (2 minutes)

### [SLIDE: Title card]
*"GitHub Basics: Version Control for Healthcare Innovators"*

### [TALKING HEAD or VOICEOVER]

> "If you've ever named a file 'FinalDraft_v2_FINAL_actuallyFinal.docx'—congratulations, you've been doing version control. You just haven't been doing it well.

> Git is a system that handles versions properly. GitHub is where teams store and collaborate on Git projects. Together, they're the standard for how every tech team, every startup, and every health AI company manages their work.

> But here's the thing—Git isn't just for coders. It's for anyone who iterates. And that's exactly what design thinking is: iterate, test, learn, improve.

> In the Health Design Sprint, your commits—your saves—become a log of your design journey. When you present your final prototype, you won't just show the finished product. You'll be able to trace how your thinking evolved. The pivots. The dead ends. The breakthroughs.

> That's why we're learning this. Not because it's a tech requirement—because it's a design documentation tool."

## SEGMENT 2: The Mental Model (3 minutes)

### [SLIDE: The 4-Zone Diagram]
```
[Your Files]  →  [Staging Area]  →  [Repository]  →  [GitHub]
   (local)        (git add)        (git commit)     (git push)
```

### [VOICEOVER with animated diagram]

> "Think of Git as having four zones. Your work flows through them, left to right.

> **Zone 1: Working Directory.** These are your actual files on your computer. Your messy desk. Nothing is tracked until you decide to track it.

> **Zone 2: Staging Area.** When you've made changes you want to keep, you 'stage' them. Think of this as stacking papers you're about to file. You're saying: 'these are ready to be saved.'

> **Zone 3: Local Repository.** When you 'commit,' you create a snapshot—a permanent save point on your machine. Like putting those papers in your filing cabinet. You include a message explaining what this snapshot represents.

> **Zone 4: Remote Repository—GitHub.** When you 'push,' you upload your commits to the cloud. Now your team can see them. This is the shared archive everyone can access.

> Here's the key insight: **you control each transition.** You work freely in Zone 1. You deliberately choose what to stage. You write a commit message explaining your thinking. And you only push when you're ready to share.

> This separation is intentional. It means you can experiment wildly without affecting the team until you're ready."

### [SLIDE: Analogy comparison]

| Action | File Analogy | Git Term |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Edit files | Writing on paper | Working directory |
| Mark as ready | Stack papers to file | `git add` (stage) |
| Save with a note | File with a label | `git commit` |
| Share with team | Put in shared drive | `git push` |

### [VOICEOVER]

> "The terminology sounds technical, but the actions are things you already do. We're just adding structure and history."

## SEGMENT 3: Setup Walkthrough (4 minutes)

### [SCREEN RECORDING: GitHub account creation]

> "Let's walk through the setup. First, you'll create a GitHub account.

> Go to github.com and click Sign Up. Use your UVA email—this unlocks educational features.

> Choose a professional username. You'll use this for years, potentially linking to it on your CV or LinkedIn, so keep it clean. Something like 'mnguyen-uva' works well.

> [Skip through confirmation steps]

> Once you're in, check your email for an invitation to the 'uva-medical-design' organization. That's our course workspace. Click accept."

### [SCREEN RECORDING: GitHub Desktop installation]

> "Next, install GitHub Desktop. This gives you a visual interface so you don't have to use the command line.

> Go to desktop.github.com and download for your operating system.

> [Show installation, sign-in process]

> When you first open it, sign in with your GitHub account. It'll ask to configure Git—just use your name and UVA email.

> Now you're connected."

### [SCREEN RECORDING: Cloning the repository]

> "Finally, let's get the course materials onto your computer. This is called 'cloning.'

> In GitHub Desktop, go to File, Clone Repository. Select the GitHub.com tab. You should see 'uva-medical-design/health-design-sprint' listed.

> Choose where you want to save it—somewhere you'll remember, like Documents/HDS-Course.

> Click Clone.

> [Show cloning progress]

> And you're done. You now have all course materials on your machine, with full version history."

## SEGMENT 4: Your First Commit (1 minute)

### [SCREEN RECORDING: Quick commit demo]

> "Here's a preview of what you'll do on Day 1. Let's say you created a new file—a reflection journal.

> [Show creating a simple text file in the repo folder]

> Back in GitHub Desktop, notice it appears under 'Changes' with a green plus sign. That means it's new and untracked.

> Check the box to stage it. Write a summary: 'Add reflection journal.' Click Commit to main.

> [Show commit button]

> Now it's saved locally. Click Push origin to share with the team.

> [Show push button]

> That's it. You've contributed to the project's permanent history."

## SEGMENT 5: Mindset Close (30 seconds)

### [TALKING HEAD or VOICEOVER]

> "One last thing. Don't worry about mastering Git before Day 1. The goal of this pre-work is just to get set up and understand the mental model.

> You'll make mistakes. You'll get confused. That's part of learning any new tool. The beautiful thing about Git is that it's designed to help you recover from mistakes—nothing is truly lost.

> Think of your commits as entries in a design journal. Each one captures a moment in your thinking. By the end of the sprint, that history becomes part of your story.

> See you on Day 1."

## Production Notes

**Visuals needed:**
1. Title card (MDP branding)
2. 4-zone diagram (animated build preferred)
3. Analogy table slide
4. Screen recordings of:
   - GitHub account creation
   - GitHub Desktop install + sign-in
   - Cloning the repo
   - Quick commit demonstration
5. Checklist slide (end card)

**Recording tips:**
- For screen recordings, use a clean browser profile (no bookmarks bar)
- Zoom to ~125% so text is readable
- Pre-create any files you'll demonstrate with
- Keep pacing conversational—this isn't a technical tutorial

**Optional B-roll:**
- Messy desk → organized files visual metaphor
- Time-lapse of someone iterating on sketches (design thinking connection)
